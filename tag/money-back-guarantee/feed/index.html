			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-189" title="Money_Back_Guarantee2" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Money_Back_Guarantee2.jpg" alt="Money_Back_Guarantee2" width="150" height="150" />While I know Im not the first to create a website to help innocent people escape imprisonment,  Im pretty sure this is the <strong>first time</strong> that anyone has ever offered a <strong>Money Back Guarantee</strong>!</p>
<p>Paul and Rachel Chandler were captured by Somali Pirates almost 100 days ago.  They are being held captive in exchange for $7 million US dollars.   However, its been reported that the pirates would be willing to &#8217;settle&#8217; with approximately $100,000.</p>
<p>This site has been created not to argue the merits of hostage negotiations nor figure out a solution to end the piracy problem.  It was created with the sole purpose of obtaining freedom for Paul and Rachel Chandler!</p>
<p>My commitment is to create a vehicle where by people can donate for the cause.  Im also committed to helping facilitate the exchange &#8211; money for the Chandlers.   If by any reason, the money raised by this site is NOT used towards the ransom of the Chandlers, then I WILL offer the donors an option of full <strong>MONEY BACK</strong> or they can have me direct the funds to the family on their behalf.</p>
<p>As stated in the &#8220;about&#8221; section of this site, my goal is not to make money from this tragic event.  As a matter of fact, I have already put several hundred dollars and a LOT of hours into this with my only goal of seeing these two innocent people escape their captors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Now you can help a cause <em>AND </em>have a Money Back Guarantee!</strong></p>
