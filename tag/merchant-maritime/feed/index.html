			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paul and Rachel Chandler, the British sailing couple taken hostage by Somali pirates in October, are approaching their 100th day in captivity.   Repeated efforts have proven unsuccessful in negotiating their release.</p>
<p>SaveTheChandlers.com was created in an attempt to raise both awareness and money to help gain the Chandlers freedom.  Via many emails from concerned citizens and heavy web traffic, it appears that more people are following as this tragic event unfolds.  However, <strong>Im sad to say that we have only raised a little over $100.</strong> If each viewer would have donated $10, I wouldn&#8217;t be writing this post right now!</p>
<p>We all have our opinions as to how to &#8220;handle&#8221; this situation.  Some believe that negotiations with pirates only encourages more kidnappings.  Others feel that we should give the money and help Paul and Rachel resume their peaceful lives.</p>
<p>Regardless of your personal and political beliefs around this matter, it appears we may be coming up against a deadline for action.   Considering the latest news obtained from telephone conversations with the Chandlers, the time to act is now!</p>
<p><strong>Here are the facts:</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the valiant efforts of the Merchant Maritime Warfare Center (MMWC) and its chairman Nick Davis, they raised $100,000 which the pirates agreed would be enough to free them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the UK Government intervened and blocked the transaction so they could not make the exchange.</p>
<p><strong>What I propose:</strong></p>
<p>Since it appears that there IS money available and the only thing preventing their freedom is the UK Government, I propose a way in which the government <em>does not have to be involved</em> in the exchange!</p>
<p>The internet is a wonderful tool and should be used in this case as well!  By using a method of money transfer such as PayPal or even wire transfer to an account, we could effectively give the pirates the previously agreed upon sum of $100,000 US.    All they need to do is set up an account in their country and we can transfer the funds.</p>
<p>This can be performed in 2 stages so both parties will feel protected.  I suggest that we transfer $50,000 <strong>UPON Rachel Chadlers </strong><strong>SAFE release and confirmed passage back to the UK</strong>.  When she is free, we will give them the money as a way of showing that we are willing to complete the exchange.  The pirates will still have Paul as collateral that we will perform our part.</p>
<p>After her exchange, the pirates should be able to see that we are willing to work with them and eager to exchange Paul for the remaining $50,000, also for his safe and confirmed release.</p>
<p><strong>If you are someone who can represent the pirates, I suggest you contact me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are a member of the MMWC and still have access to the funds, I suggest you contact me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are a concerned citizen who wants to help (either through money or other support), I suggest you contact me!</strong></p>
<p>Once again, my goal is not to challenge the pros and cons of hostage negotiations, its merely to see that Paul and Rachel have a chance to live out their natural lives!</p>
