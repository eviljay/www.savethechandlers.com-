					<p>The release of Paul Chandler after more than a year in captivity at the hands of Somali pirates was mixed with sadness as he learnt of the death of his father for the first time.</p>
<p>During his time as a hostage Mr Chandler had repeatedly voiced fears for his father, Alfred, who reached the age of 99 in June but did not live to see his son released.</p>
<p>On an internet blog on which they charted their adventures travelling in their yacht the Lynn Rival, they described spending much of the time at Mr Chandler’s home which they described as a “lovely place to relax by the sea.”<br />
In one of the last updates before their disappearance while sailing from the Seychelles to Tanzania, they posted a photograph of the sea view from Mr Chandler’s home labelled as “a reminder of Dartmouth”.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>For the past 388 days, Paul and Rachel Chandler have been held captive when their sailboat was hijacked by Somali Pirates in the Indian Ocean.  Almost a month after they were kidnapped, I was informed of their plight as I watched the evening news.   While the TV is often filled with horrible stories, this one seemed to stand out among the crowd.  I guess seeing a video of two innocent people being held at gun point really moved me!</p>
<p>Sometimes a person gets so inspired that they join a worthy cause so they can &#8220;make a difference&#8221;.   I felt compelled to help these two unfortunate people, but had absolutely no idea how.  After all, I did&#8217;t know them, didn&#8217;t know their family or friends, didn&#8217;t have any contacts in their homeland of England and certainly didn&#8217;t have any knowledge of Somalia or even pirates.  Not to mention, Im also almost 10,000 miles away.   So, I thought,  how could one person from California possibly help?</p>
<p>A few months before this happened, I had read an article about the rescue of Capt. Richard Phillips.  After a 5 day stand off with Somali pirates, the captain and his crew, along with their cargo ship, were freed with the help of the U.S. Navy.  I figured if I attracted the attention of the right people, this too could be resolved quickly.   Therefore, I thought it would be a good idea to use the power of the internet to raise awareness so people with more power than me would feel compelled to step in and offer assistance.</p>
<p>Shortly after I set up this site, more news surfaced about the Chandlers.  There were articles about physical abuse and possible executions if demands weren&#8217;t immediately met.    Amidst all the reports, different figures were published as to the amount of the ransom being requested by the pirates.  As I was posting these news articles, the site gained in popularity and attracted more attention that I had anticipated.</p>
<p>On quite a few occasions, I fielded emails from both soldier-of-fortune wannabes and legitimate organizations that were actually qualified to help, albeit for a hefty daily fee.  I was also contacted by quite a few people asking the same question, &#8220;What can I do to help?&#8221;.  While it looked like my idea of raising awareness had worked, I began to notice something else which was rather disturbing.  It appeared that the pirates were trying to use the media to help increase the Chandlers&#8217; &#8220;value&#8221; and in turn the amount of their ransom demand.  When I discovered this, I realized that posting all the news that was floating around the internet wasn&#8217;t such a good idea.  I was also convinced, by some well known organizations who deal with this type of activity all the time, that I should be very careful about what I say.   After all, the last thing I wanted to do was is to make matters worse so I took <em>some</em> of their advice.</p>
<p>Well, its been 388 days and Im pleased to say:</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;font-size:16px;">PAUL AND RACHEL CHANDLER ARE FINALLY FREE!!!</span></p>
<p>Im sure Paul &amp; Rachel, their family and the viewers of this site are also excited to hear this news!  I wish the Chandlers a very happy homecoming and hope they can resume their lives quickly.</p>
<p>For those of you that were also compelled to offer your support through private emails and contributions, THANK YOU!   As for the money this site raised, while it was an <em>extremely small amount</em>, it was still successfully used as it was to be intended.</p>
<p>As for who I am now that this is finally over, well, lets just say that Im just an average guy named Scott from California who has learned quite a bit during this journey!  I&#8217;ve met amazing people along the way and have been enlightened by some of the injustice that occurs outside my countries borders.  And, when all that can be revealed is published, I hope that my efforts did more good than harm at helping 2 strangers Ive never met secure their freedom.</p>

					<p>On Sunday March 14th, 2010, disturbing news was released to the media regarding Rachel Chandler.    Allegedly, she has been wounded by a small caliber bullet fired by a Somali pirate.  </p>
<p>I have yet to find any evidence that supports the validity of this announcement, so I’m not going to re-post the original story.  Also, as barbaric as this tragedy is, I haven’t found any evidence that the pirates harm their captives without provocation.    </p>
<p>Regardless, the fact remains that both Rachel and Paul Chandler are still being held captive after almost 5 months and we would like to see them rejoin their families!  Hopefully we will see some positive news soon!</p>

<p>Paul Chandler and his wife Rachel, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, were captured while sailing from the Seychelles towards Tanzania in October last year.</p>
<p>Somali deputy parliamentary speaker Mohamed Omar Dalha said he was hopeful they would be freed within two weeks. He said that communities inside and outside the war-ravaged country have been working to negotiate their unconditional release.</p>
<p>Stephen Collett &#8211; Mrs Chandler&#8217;s brother &#8211; refused to be drawn on any details of the hoped-for release but said he was &#8220;pleased&#8221; by the news. He has been in contact with the pirates via local broadcasters and the Foreign Office, who have been working towards their release.</p>
<p>The Chandlers are among about 130 sailors held hostage in Somalia.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview with a Somali television station, Mrs Chandler, who has recently appeared gaunt in pictures, said: &#8220;I&#8217;m obviously very tormented and very, very lonely and worried.&#8221; Meanwhile, Mr Chandler described their forced partition as &#8220;torture&#8221;.</p>
<p>The British Government has refused to pay a ransom for the couple and called for their immediate release. The Somali pirates have previously demanded a &#8220;seven million dollars&#8221; (£4.6 million) ransom for their safe release.</p>
<p>In a phone call translated by the BBC, one of the pirates said: &#8220;If they do not harm us, we will not harm them &#8211; we only need a little amount of seven million dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Chandler, 59, and his wife, 55, were captured when armed men boarded their yacht as they slept.</p>
<p>It has since emerged that the crew of a Royal Navy vessel was forced to watch the Chandlers being kidnapped by pirates but military officials have insisted that the Royal Fleet Auxiliary replenishment tanker Wave Knight, carrying 75 merchant seamen and 25 Royal Navy sailors, could not have acted without endangering the lives of the couple.</p>

					<p>Somali pirates yesterday threatened a fight to the death that would endanger a hostage British couple if British forces attempt to rescue their captives.</p>
<p>“We die first before they get freed,” said one of the pirates, contacted by satellite telephone.</p>
<p>Paul and Rachel Chandler, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, were captured on October 23 as they sailed their yacht, the 38ft Lynn Rival, from the Seychelles towards Tanzania.</p>
<p>The pirates’ new threat follows reports that an operation mounted by the Special Boat Service to rescue the couple was “bungled” before it could reach them because of technical problems.</p>
<p>If anyone interrupts our negotiations to get the payment of a ransom, it will be a risk for them [the Chandlers],” said “Gelle”, one of the pirates guarding the couple. “So we advise that no one interrupts our current good discussions.”</p>
<p>In the only comment that held some hope for the Chandlers, Gelle said that they had lowered their demand from $7m to $2m “or whatever price that we agree”. It was a clear signal that the pirates are open to offers.</p>
<p>Last week a Greek tanker, Maran Centaurus, was released for a reported $5.5m to $7m.</p>
<p>Gelle said that his group had spoken yesterday and on Friday with one of five brokers supposedly involved in negotiating a ransom. He said he believed the brokers were negotiating with “close relatives of our hostages, or other people trusted on behalf of them”.</p>
<p>The pirates are based in Haradheere, a fishing village north of the capital, Mogadishu. As well as the Chandlers, pirates are holding 11 ships, including the British-flagged chemical tanker St James Park which was seized on December 28.</p>
<p>Chandler, 59, said in an earlier telephone interview with ITV News, broadcast last week, that he and his wife, 55, had been separated and beaten and that he expected to be killed within “three or four days”.</p>
<p>Gelle denied the Chandlers were living under difficult conditions. “Okay, maybe they don’t feel good or comfortable but according to us they are fine,” he said.</p>
<p>“We also live in this situation so we do not think that they are that different from us. Once we get food, we share with them, and when there is a shortage of food they suffer with us.”</p>

<p>Paul and Rachel Chandler were captured by Somali Pirates almost 100 days ago.  They are being held captive in exchange for $7 million US dollars.   However, its been reported that the pirates would be willing to &#8217;settle&#8217; with approximately $100,000.</p>
<p>This site has been created not to argue the merits of hostage negotiations nor figure out a solution to end the piracy problem.  It was created with the sole purpose of obtaining freedom for Paul and Rachel Chandler!</p>
<p>My commitment is to create a vehicle where by people can donate for the cause.  Im also committed to helping facilitate the exchange &#8211; money for the Chandlers.   If by any reason, the money raised by this site is NOT used towards the ransom of the Chandlers, then I WILL offer the donors an option of full <strong>MONEY BACK</strong> or they can have me direct the funds to the family on their behalf.</p>
<p>As stated in the &#8220;about&#8221; section of this site, my goal is not to make money from this tragic event.  As a matter of fact, I have already put several hundred dollars and a LOT of hours into this with my only goal of seeing these two innocent people escape their captors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Now you can help a cause <em>AND </em>have a Money Back Guarantee!</strong></p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Paul and Rachel Chandler, the British sailing couple taken hostage by Somali pirates in October, are approaching their 100th day in captivity.   Repeated efforts have proven unsuccessful in negotiating their release.</p>
<p>SaveTheChandlers.com was created in an attempt to raise both awareness and money to help gain the Chandlers freedom.  Via many emails from concerned citizens and heavy web traffic, it appears that more people are following as this tragic event unfolds.  However, <strong>Im sad to say that we have only raised a little over $100.</strong> If each viewer would have donated $10, I wouldn&#8217;t be writing this post right now!</p>
<p>We all have our opinions as to how to &#8220;handle&#8221; this situation.  Some believe that negotiations with pirates only encourages more kidnappings.  Others feel that we should give the money and help Paul and Rachel resume their peaceful lives.</p>
<p>Regardless of your personal and political beliefs around this matter, it appears we may be coming up against a deadline for action.   Considering the latest news obtained from telephone conversations with the Chandlers, the time to act is now!</p>
<p><strong>Here are the facts:</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the valiant efforts of the Merchant Maritime Warfare Center (MMWC) and its chairman Nick Davis, they raised $100,000 which the pirates agreed would be enough to free them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the UK Government intervened and blocked the transaction so they could not make the exchange.</p>
<p><strong>What I propose:</strong></p>
<p>Since it appears that there IS money available and the only thing preventing their freedom is the UK Government, I propose a way in which the government <em>does not have to be involved</em> in the exchange!</p>
<p>The internet is a wonderful tool and should be used in this case as well!  By using a method of money transfer such as PayPal or even wire transfer to an account, we could effectively give the pirates the previously agreed upon sum of $100,000 US.    All they need to do is set up an account in their country and we can transfer the funds.</p>
<p>This can be performed in 2 stages so both parties will feel protected.  I suggest that we transfer $50,000 <strong>UPON Rachel Chadlers </strong><strong>SAFE release and confirmed passage back to the UK</strong>.  When she is free, we will give them the money as a way of showing that we are willing to complete the exchange.  The pirates will still have Paul as collateral that we will perform our part.</p>
<p>After her exchange, the pirates should be able to see that we are willing to work with them and eager to exchange Paul for the remaining $50,000, also for his safe and confirmed release.</p>
<p><strong>If you are someone who can represent the pirates, I suggest you contact me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are a member of the MMWC and still have access to the funds, I suggest you contact me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are a concerned citizen who wants to help (either through money or other support), I suggest you contact me!</strong></p>
<p>Once again, my goal is not to challenge the pros and cons of hostage negotiations, its merely to see that Paul and Rachel have a chance to live out their natural lives!</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>According to news posting by CNN, it appears the Somali pirates who are holding hostage the British sailors Paul and Rachel Chandler are close to killing them.</p>
<p>Repeated responses from the British Government have stated that they will not participate in negotiations with pirates.  While the ransom was first set at $7 million, several weeks ago the pirates agreed to a much lessor amount of $100,000.  The funds were raised however the exchange was blocked by the government.</p>
<p>CNN affiliate ITN has reported in separate telephone interviews that the couple pleaded for help and said they were fearful of being days away from death.</p>
<p>During the conversation with Rachel Chandler, she said &#8220;dying would actually be an easy way out&#8221; and that she wanted to see Paul &#8220;at least once before we die.&#8221;   She also told the reporter that she had not seen her husband for two weeks since they were violently separated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve broken a tooth because I was hit on the head with something, probably the butt of a gun&#8230;I don&#8217;t know&#8230;and yes, so we have been physically attacked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rachel continued to say, &#8220;They&#8217;ve just told me that if they dont get the money within for or five days they&#8217;ll kill one of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>In tears, she asked for a message to be passed along to her husband.   &#8220;The message to him is hang on for me because I hope &#8211; my biggest hope &#8211; is that I shall see him at least once before we die.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;It&#8217;s hard not to feel , well, dying would actually be an easy way out.  It&#8217;s hard to explain but it is when you&#8217;re all on your own in this country and you&#8217;ve no idea where you are and no idea when something might happen and whether I&#8217;ll see Paul again.  It&#8217;s just very, very despairing&#8221;</p>
<p>During a separate telephone interview one day earlier, Paul Chandler, 59, described how they were separated and savagely beaten.</p>
<p>&#8220;We tried to stay together and they threw us to the ground and whipped us and beat Rachel with a rifle butt and I was dragged off, taken to a different location.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was allowed to telephone her about 12 days ago.  She said she was being tormented all the time and then she said she was giving up.   They&#8217;ve lost patience.  They set a deadline of three or four days, if they don&#8217;t hear, then they say they will let us die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re held in solitary confinement effectively.  You know it&#8217;s just [like being] treated as a captive animal.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not clear under what conditions the captives, who have been in sporadic telephone and video contact with journalists, had been allowed telephone access. ITN said both conversations had been shared with the British Home Office and his family.</p>
<p>Britain&#8217;s Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#8217;s official line on hostages says &#8220;the government will not make substantive concession for hostage takers, including the payments of ransom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pirates have been very active off the east coast of Africa in the past several years, operating out of lawless Somalia.</p>
<p>Last week, pirates attempted to hijack an Indian crude oil vessel 105 nautical miles from Somalia, the EU&#8217;s anti-piracy naval force said. The pirates opened fire on the ship and were later arrested.</p>
<p>Piracy on the high-seas reached a six-year high in 2009, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors shipping crimes.</p>

					<p>Its unfortunate and sad that Paul and Rachel Chandler will not be celebrating Christmas this year with their family.</p>
<p>Kidnapped on October 22, 2009 by Somali pirates, the two british sailors are still being held by their captors.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed reports state that Somali&#8217;s Radio Gaalkacyo said the couple faced daily threats from the pirates who hijacked their yacht.</p>
<p>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said it was continuing to monitor the situation &#8220;closely&#8221;.  This comes after several failed attempts to seek the release of the Chandlers.</p>
<div id="attachment_20" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 270px"><img class="size-full wp-image-20 " title="Paul and Rachel Chandler taken captive by Somali Pirates" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/s-PAUL-AND-RACHEL-CHANDLER-large.jpg" alt="Paul and Rachel Chandler taken captive by Somali Pirates" width="260" height="190" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Paul and Rachel Chandler held captive by Somali Pirates</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
<p>Radio reports on Wednesday from the coastal town of Xarardheer, also known as Harardheer, said the hostages were facing difficult living conditions while in captivity.</p>
<p>The pirates have previously demanded $7 million in a phone call to the BBC, and said they would shoot Paul and Rachel if it were not paid.</p>
<p>Negotiations have enticed the pirates to accept a much lessor sum of $165,000, however the British government intervened and blocked the transaction.</p>
<p>The FCO has previously expressed sympathy for the victims&#8217; families, but has continued to reiterate its position that it does not &#8220;make substantive concessions to hostage takers, including ransoms&#8221;.</p>
<p>Their family made another appeal for their release after seeing the footage of them surrounded by gunmen.</p>
