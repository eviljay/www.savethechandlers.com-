			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people have been asking for an update on Paul and Rachel Chandler considering its been over 60 days since news was last released.  Sadly, the Chandlers are still being held captive by the Somali pirates with no indication as to when they may be released.</p>
<p>While we continue to remain focused on helping Paul and Rachel obtain their freedom, we are also concerned about the overall piracy activity in the region.   Since insurance companies usually settle these cases without much media involvement, the public is unaware of how rampant this situation has become.</p>
<p>The International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) is currently running a big campaign to fight piracy and to persuade governments to commit resources necessary to end the increasing problem of Somalia-based piracy.  Below is a link that will take you to a petition to help move this initiative forward.   Please consider signing it!</p>
