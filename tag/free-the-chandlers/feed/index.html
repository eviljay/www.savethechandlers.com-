<p>The family of the kidnapped British sailors have pleaded for their release.   Im glad to see that they are trying to persuade the pirated to do the &#8220;humanitarian thing and let them go&#8221;, as quoted by BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner. </p>
<p>According to reports it appears that they (the Chandlers) are very concerned about an Islamist group in Somalia called Al-Shabaab possibly &#8216;purchasing&#8217; them and placing more demands.  </p>
<p>In a video released yesterday Mrs Chandler said: “We are told that there is a terrorist cell, or a fanatic cell, searching for us and we are also feeling very much under threat now that these people themselves won’t hesitate to take our lives.”</p>
