<p>The yacht which British couple Paul and Rachel Chandler were on when they were abducted by Somali pirates has been returned to Portland Harbor, in Dorset UK.</p>
<p>The Chandlers are still being held for ransom for a reported $7 million, however news posts have mentioned that the pirates may be willing to negotiate for a lesser amount.</p>
<p>The yacht, Lynn Rival was picked up by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Wave Knight. The Wave Knight returned to British waters yesterday to unload the yacht.</p>
<p>According to members on the military vessel, the crew had been &#8216;forced&#8217; to watch as the couple were kidnapped by pirates. Military officials insisted the crew members could not have acted without endangering the Chandlers lives.</p>
<p>There were 75 merchant seamen and 25 sailors aboard the Wave Knight at the time of the abduction.</p>
<p>The couple were forced to change course to Somalia before being put on a container ship, the Kota Wajar, which had also been taken by the pirates. Based on videos released last week, they now appear to be ashore.</p>
<p>Mr Chandler, a quantity surveyor, and his economist wife have spent several six-month spells at sea.</p>
<p>It later emerged the Wave Knight, carrying a helicopter, was near to the drama.</p>
<p>A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: “Every effort was made by the Royal Navy and the international maritime fleet to locate the Lynn Rival.</p>
<p>“We did everything we could possibly do without further endangering the lives of Paul and Rachel Chandler.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The stats are showing that the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=204931118668" target="_blank">FaceBook group dedicated to Paul and Rachel Chandler</a> have more then doubled since last night at 11:00pm to 170 members.  This site has gathered some attention from search engines and concerned readers.  However, I am still looking for others to <strong>take over this blog!</strong></p>
<p>My goal is to help the Chandlers, however I cant do it on my own.  If you want to <strong>help Paul and Rachel Chandler</strong> obtain freedom from their Somali captives, then spreading the word about this subject (and posting blogs) is imperative!</p>
<p>I have no idea if raising money or spreading awareness is the best thing to do for this couple that was hijacked last month.  But, what I do know, is that if more people offer to help and support this cause then it WILL get the attention of the powers that be that can make something positive happen!</p>
<p>I cant stress this enough, I (or we, if I can speak collectively for the FaceBook group) need help with posting information about this subject until it is resolved.  I cant help but think that if nobody steps up to the plate and offers to lend a hand then the result will not be good for this couple.</p>
<p>Help today by contacting me at <strong>SaveTheChandlers@gmail.com</strong> or on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=204931118668" target="_blank">FaceBook group</a> and I will give you full access to posting on this this site.</p>
