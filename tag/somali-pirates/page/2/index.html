					<p>Paul and Rachel Chandler, the British sailing couple taken hostage by Somali pirates in October, are approaching their 100th day in captivity.   Repeated efforts have proven unsuccessful in negotiating their release.</p>
<p>SaveTheChandlers.com was created in an attempt to raise both awareness and money to help gain the Chandlers freedom.  Via many emails from concerned citizens and heavy web traffic, it appears that more people are following as this tragic event unfolds.  However, <strong>Im sad to say that we have only raised a little over $100.</strong> If each viewer would have donated $10, I wouldn&#8217;t be writing this post right now!</p>
<p>We all have our opinions as to how to &#8220;handle&#8221; this situation.  Some believe that negotiations with pirates only encourages more kidnappings.  Others feel that we should give the money and help Paul and Rachel resume their peaceful lives.</p>
<p>Regardless of your personal and political beliefs around this matter, it appears we may be coming up against a deadline for action.   Considering the latest news obtained from telephone conversations with the Chandlers, the time to act is now!</p>
<p><strong>Here are the facts:</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the valiant efforts of the Merchant Maritime Warfare Center (MMWC) and its chairman Nick Davis, they raised $100,000 which the pirates agreed would be enough to free them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the UK Government intervened and blocked the transaction so they could not make the exchange.</p>
<p><strong>What I propose:</strong></p>
<p>Since it appears that there IS money available and the only thing preventing their freedom is the UK Government, I propose a way in which the government <em>does not have to be involved</em> in the exchange!</p>
<p>The internet is a wonderful tool and should be used in this case as well!  By using a method of money transfer such as PayPal or even wire transfer to an account, we could effectively give the pirates the previously agreed upon sum of $100,000 US.    All they need to do is set up an account in their country and we can transfer the funds.</p>
<p>This can be performed in 2 stages so both parties will feel protected.  I suggest that we transfer $50,000 <strong>UPON Rachel Chadlers </strong><strong>SAFE release and confirmed passage back to the UK</strong>.  When she is free, we will give them the money as a way of showing that we are willing to complete the exchange.  The pirates will still have Paul as collateral that we will perform our part.</p>
<p>After her exchange, the pirates should be able to see that we are willing to work with them and eager to exchange Paul for the remaining $50,000, also for his safe and confirmed release.</p>
<p><strong>If you are someone who can represent the pirates, I suggest you contact me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are a member of the MMWC and still have access to the funds, I suggest you contact me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are a concerned citizen who wants to help (either through money or other support), I suggest you contact me!</strong></p>
<p>Once again, my goal is not to challenge the pros and cons of hostage negotiations, its merely to see that Paul and Rachel have a chance to live out their natural lives!</p>

					<p>According to news posting by CNN, it appears the Somali pirates who are holding hostage the British sailors Paul and Rachel Chandler are close to killing them.</p>
<p>Repeated responses from the British Government have stated that they will not participate in negotiations with pirates.  While the ransom was first set at $7 million, several weeks ago the pirates agreed to a much lessor amount of $100,000.  The funds were raised however the exchange was blocked by the government.</p>
<p>CNN affiliate ITN has reported in separate telephone interviews that the couple pleaded for help and said they were fearful of being days away from death.</p>
<p>During the conversation with Rachel Chandler, she said &#8220;dying would actually be an easy way out&#8221; and that she wanted to see Paul &#8220;at least once before we die.&#8221;   She also told the reporter that she had not seen her husband for two weeks since they were violently separated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve broken a tooth because I was hit on the head with something, probably the butt of a gun&#8230;I don&#8217;t know&#8230;and yes, so we have been physically attacked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rachel continued to say, &#8220;They&#8217;ve just told me that if they dont get the money within for or five days they&#8217;ll kill one of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>In tears, she asked for a message to be passed along to her husband.   &#8220;The message to him is hang on for me because I hope &#8211; my biggest hope &#8211; is that I shall see him at least once before we die.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;It&#8217;s hard not to feel , well, dying would actually be an easy way out.  It&#8217;s hard to explain but it is when you&#8217;re all on your own in this country and you&#8217;ve no idea where you are and no idea when something might happen and whether I&#8217;ll see Paul again.  It&#8217;s just very, very despairing&#8221;</p>
<p>During a separate telephone interview one day earlier, Paul Chandler, 59, described how they were separated and savagely beaten.</p>
<p>&#8220;We tried to stay together and they threw us to the ground and whipped us and beat Rachel with a rifle butt and I was dragged off, taken to a different location.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was allowed to telephone her about 12 days ago.  She said she was being tormented all the time and then she said she was giving up.   They&#8217;ve lost patience.  They set a deadline of three or four days, if they don&#8217;t hear, then they say they will let us die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re held in solitary confinement effectively.  You know it&#8217;s just [like being] treated as a captive animal.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not clear under what conditions the captives, who have been in sporadic telephone and video contact with journalists, had been allowed telephone access. ITN said both conversations had been shared with the British Home Office and his family.</p>
<p>Britain&#8217;s Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#8217;s official line on hostages says &#8220;the government will not make substantive concession for hostage takers, including the payments of ransom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pirates have been very active off the east coast of Africa in the past several years, operating out of lawless Somalia.</p>
<p>Last week, pirates attempted to hijack an Indian crude oil vessel 105 nautical miles from Somalia, the EU&#8217;s anti-piracy naval force said. The pirates opened fire on the ship and were later arrested.</p>
<p>Piracy on the high-seas reached a six-year high in 2009, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors shipping crimes.</p>

					<p>There are reports that the Somali pirates holding the British couple, Rachel and Paul Chandler, are demanding payment of ransom within two months. There is no question that their demand is unacceptable. Giving in to such a demand will encourage criminality. However, Somalia Research Report is of the opinion that not all the right buttons have been pressed to facilitate the unconditional  release of the British couple who were in their yatch off the Somalia coast when the pirates captured them nearly three months ago.</p>
<p>We believe   Rachel and Paul Chandler  can be released provided the British government take the right steps since it dealt with a case far more complicated than this: that of the gangster Mustaf  Jama who murdered the British policewoman  Sharon Beshenivsky in 2005,  and fled to Somalia. Mustaf Jama  was brought back to United Kingdom  from Somalia to face justice. We are not calling for a similar approach to nab the pirates holding   the British couple but to see a productive cooperation between the British government and the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia (TFG) and its ally Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama’a group near where the pirates are based.</p>
<p>Both the TFG and Ahlu Sunna Wal  Jama’a   can use their leverage to persuade the pirates to release the couple. Few months ago the prime minister of Somalia’s TFG Omar Sharmarke  was received at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Although the Somalia’s TFG  prime minister does not hail from the area where pirates are holding the British couple, he , along with the Somali president  and other influential Southern politicians   and traditional leaders can put effort into bringing the whole hostage saga to a peaceful end.</p>
<p>The release of Rachel and Paul Chandler can be secured if the British Government and Somali authorities cooperate. We demand the unconditional release of Rachel and Paul Chandler NOW.</p>

					<p>Its unfortunate and sad that Paul and Rachel Chandler will not be celebrating Christmas this year with their family.</p>
<p>Kidnapped on October 22, 2009 by Somali pirates, the two british sailors are still being held by their captors.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed reports state that Somali&#8217;s Radio Gaalkacyo said the couple faced daily threats from the pirates who hijacked their yacht.</p>
<p>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said it was continuing to monitor the situation &#8220;closely&#8221;.  This comes after several failed attempts to seek the release of the Chandlers.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; ">
<p>Radio reports on Wednesday from the coastal town of Xarardheer, also known as Harardheer, said the hostages were facing difficult living conditions while in captivity.</p>
<p>The pirates have previously demanded $7 million in a phone call to the BBC, and said they would shoot Paul and Rachel if it were not paid.</p>
<p>Negotiations have enticed the pirates to accept a much lessor sum of $165,000, however the British government intervened and blocked the transaction.</p>
<p>The FCO has previously expressed sympathy for the victims&#8217; families, but has continued to reiterate its position that it does not &#8220;make substantive concessions to hostage takers, including ransoms&#8221;.</p>
<p>Their family made another appeal for their release after seeing the footage of them surrounded by gunmen.</p>

					<p>he British couple held by Somali pirates have pleaded with the government to get them “out by Christmas, by whatever means”.</p>
<p>In their first telephone call for five weeks, Paul and Rachel Chandler urged the authorities to talk to their captors to help free them.</p>
<p>The Chandlers, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, were kidnapped while they sailed their yacht, Lynn Rival, near the Seychelles in late October.</p>
<p>Paul Chandler, 59, a retired quantity surveyor, who sounded calm, said: “I would like to say to the British government: get us out by Christmas, by whatever means.” But indicating his disillusion, he added: “We don’t think there’s much chance, seriously.”</p>
<p>The Sunday Times obtained the interview with Chandler and his 55-year-old wife through a local journalist, “Omar”, who travelled to the area where they are being held and allowed them to speak to this newspaper via his mobile phone.</p>
<p>There were unconfirmed reports last week that the couple were on the verge of being freed for a $100,000 (£61,500) ransom when the government blocked the deal. In response to that claim, Chandler said: “We have no knowledge of what is happening in Britain except that we have been told that the government has refused to become involved.</p>
<p>“As far as we are concerned it is not a straightforward piracy business, it is a plain criminal kidnapping and &#8230; should be approached with a rather different approach than the government uses.</p>
<p>“When you have a criminal gang carrying out a kidnapping, [the government] should not be averse to negotiating with that gang and following it up with whatever means. I don’t think the government should step back and say ‘this is nothing to do with us’.”</p>
<p>The pirates had demanded a ransom of $7m but, when handed the phone, the gang’s leader would only say: “We do not wish to put a figure on the couple’s head but what I would say is that we are open to negotiations.”</p>
<p>The Foreign Office refuses to negotiate with hostage takers. A spokesman said: “We call for the release of Paul and Rachel. Our efforts are ongoing to secure the safe release of the couple. We are in close touch with the family.”</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defence (MoD) yesterday admitted that Bob Ainsworth, the defence secretary, had authorised a Royal Marine unit that witnessed the kidnapping to intervene. But it said it was the ship’s commander who decided it was unsafe to attempt a rescue.</p>
<p>The RFA Wave Knight was within 50 yards of the pirates and had a marine unit and a Merlin helicopter aboard. But Sir Mark Stanhope, the first sea lord, claimed the ship did not have the expertise required for a hostage rescue.</p>
<p>An MoD spokesman defended the failure to intervene. “It was entirely proper for those responsible for carrying out the operation to make tactical level decisions,” he said.</p>
<p>“Those responsible for carrying out the operation had to balance capabilities and possible actions against the risk to life.”</p>
<p>Pirates usually keep the crews aboard after hijacking ships. But they abandoned the Chandlers’ yacht and took them to the mainland. They are now moving around, living in Land Cruisers which are changed regularly.</p>
<p>The gang appears desperate to ransom the couple because other groups, including hard-line Islamists, are threatening to attack them.</p>
<p>When the Chandlers complained to Omar about the lack of communication to the outside world, he gave them his radio. He also gave them his pen.</p>
<p>The couple are drinking plenty of water but not eating well as they are finding it difficult to consume the local dishes of meat, rice, pasta and a traditional Somali pancake known as anjeero.</p>
<p>Omar said that Paul Chandler seemed to have lost weight since the couple were last seen in a film broadcast on November 20. The video showed them looking thin and fatigued, pleading for the government to start negotiating with the gangs and saying they might otherwise be killed.</p>
<p>Somali pirates do not normally harm their hostages but this case appears to be more complicated. In commercial piracy, the gangs deal with insurance firms or shipping companies which would eventually pay a ransom.</p>
<p>However, the Chandlers, who are both retired, had sold their house in Britain to go sailing and have no money.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The <span>disturbing truth behind the Royal Navy’s failure to prevent Somali pirates kidnapping a British couple from their yacht can be revealed today.</span></p>
<p> An investigation by The Mail on Sunday demolishes accounts by the Ministry of Defence and the head of the Navy which suggest that a naval vessel at the scene had no rescue force available.</p>
<p>In fact, far from being a toothless bystander, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Wave Knight was within seconds of unleashing a crack team of 20 lethally armed Royal Marines.</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="attachment_122" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 384px"><img class="size-full wp-image-122 " title="Paul and Rachel Chandler held captive by Somali pirates" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/pic1.jpg" alt="So close to freedom: The Chandlers are still in captivity.

They have been filmed saying they were ‘unharmed’ but that their captors were losing patience</p></div>
<p>Wave Knight’s crew have been so angered by the official portrayal of events that one witness has given us a career-risking statement.</p>
<p>His evidence raises troubling questions about Government and military policy on piracy. And many people will want to know why an elite commando troop, mustered in black combat fatigues only yards from the kidnappers, was not permitted to put its air and seaborne assault training into action. </p>
<p>The astonishing stand-off occurred on day six of the hostage crisis as the pirates attempted to transfer Paul Chandler, 59, and his wife, Rachel, 55, to their mother ship.</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="attachment_123" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 384px"><img class="size-full wp-image-123 " title="Militar ship RFA Wave Knight" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/pic2.jpg" alt="Witness: The military ship RFA Wave Knight which allegedly watched as the Chandlers were taken captive by Somalian pirates" width="374" height="229" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Witness: The military ship RFA Wave Knight which allegedly watched as the Chandlers were taken captive by Somalian pirates</p></div>
<p>The Chandlers had been seized early on October 23 as they tried to sail their yacht, Lynn Rival, from the Seychelles across the Indian Ocean to Tanzania.</p>
<p>The couple no doubt believed their voyage was safe. In the past, Somali pirates have operated closer to their home ports some 1,000 miles north.</p>
<p> But increasing anti-piracy patrols by Nato and other navies have pushed them south to seek new hunting grounds, and armed pirates aboard at least two fast motorised skiffs ambushed them only 150 miles into the trip. </p>
<p>The Chandlers, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, managed to send out a distress call but were quickly overpowered.</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="attachment_124" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 384px"><img class="size-full wp-image-124 " title="Lynn Rival" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/pic3.jpg" alt="The Chandlers' yacht, lashed to the deck of the Wave Knight" width="374" height="257" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Chandlers&#39; yacht, lashed to the deck of the Wave Knight</p></div>
<p>Realising it would take too long and be too risky to sail Lynn Rival back to northern Somalia, the kidnappers radioed for support from one of the country’s most notorious pirate ‘nests’ – Haradheere.</p>
<p>Within 72 hours, accomplices were sailing south in the 24,000-ton container vessel Kota Wajar, itself hijacked while en route from Shanghai to Kenya on October 15.</p>
<p>On October 26, the commander of Wave Knight, Captain Clarke, was briefed on the crisis. Intelligence sources had uncovered Kota Wajar’s role as mother ship to the kidnappers and she was being tracked.</p>
<p>As the closest Royal Navy ship available, Wave Knight was ordered to find her and slow her down by any means. A Wave class supply ship, she is mostly crewed by 75 civilians working under military discipline.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;They had just trained for exactly this scenario&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>However, crucially, Captain Clarke had on board the Marines, a Merlin helicopter and firepower in the form of 30mm and 50mm cannons. Around 25 Royal Navy sailors were also present.</p>
<p>The MoD’s first version of events avoided mentioning any chase, confrontation or rescue plan. This was all air-brushed out of the official picture – along with the Marines.</p>
<p>Indeed, the MoD at first acknowledged simply that an unnamed Royal Navy vessel had come across the Chandlers’ empty yacht. Only after the Daily Mail revealed that Wave Knight was almost alongside the Chandlers, her crew watching as the couple were hustled aboard the Kota Wajar, did the MoD change stance.</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="attachment_125" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 220px"><img class="size-full wp-image-125 " title="Lynn Rival belonging to Paul and Rachel Chandler" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/pic4.jpg" alt="The yacht belonging to Paul and Rachel Chandler being unloaded at Portland Port in Dorset" width="210" height="381" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The yacht belonging to Paul and Rachel Chandler being unloaded at Portland Port in Dorset</p></div>
<p>A second, carefully worded statement then claimed that ‘everything possible was done without further endangering the lives of Paul and Rachel Chandler’.</p>
<p>It added: ‘We do not comment on operational detail but RFA Wave Knight did very well under the circumstances.’</p>
<p>Days later, the head of the Navy, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, went further, insisting that Wave Knight’s ‘sailors with pistols couldn’t do the job of ensuring the safety of the Chandlers’.</p>
<p>And even last week he insisted that everything possible had been done to rescue the Chandlers.</p>
<p>In a speech at Chatham House, he said: ‘Wave Knight did exactly the right thing&#8230; Had there been an opportunity to intervene, while being sure of guaranteeing Paul and Rachel Chandlers’ safety, they would have done so.’</p>
<p>In fact, according to our source, these official explanations are travesties of the truth. His account states that Wave Knight left her British base at Bahrain around October 14 and headed south into the Gulf of Aden’s so-called ‘pirate alley’.</p>
<p>Her role included servicing and refuelling ships from Nato’s task force but she was also fully equipped for boarding operations.</p>
<p>As news of the Chandlers’ kidnap spread around the world, the crew kept in touch with developments via news websites. On October 26, Captain Clarke issued a loudspeaker announcement, or ‘information pipe’, explaining that they were heading south – away from traditional pirate waters. Although he didn’t mention the Lynn Rival by name, our source says it was obvious to the crew that a rescue attempt was ‘on the cards’.</p>
<p>The 31,500-ton Wave Knight sighted the Kota Wajar on the evening of October 28 and immediately tried to intimidate her by closing to less than 100 yards. At this point the Lynn Rival was not in sight so there were no hostages on board the pirate ship.</p>
<p>The supply ship was ‘closed up’ for action – meaning that all hatches, doors and gun emplacements were sealed with personnel out of sight. Lights were extinguished except for the powerful searchlights raking back and forth across the Kota Wajar’s hull.</p>
<p>At first the pirates appeared to be unconcerned. Their vessel was, in the source’s words, ‘lit up like a Christmas tree’ for the first 30 minutes.</p>
<p>But suddenly it, too, snapped out its lights and the two ships steamed alongside each other in darkness.</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="attachment_126" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 384px"><img class="size-full wp-image-126 " title="Paul and Rachel Chandler" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/pic5.jpg" alt="Kidnapped: Paul and Rachel Chandler were sailing around the world when their boat was hijacked by Somalian pirates" width="374" height="255" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kidnapped: Paul and Rachel Chandler were sailing around the world when their boat was hijacked by Somalian pirates</p></div>
<p>But Wave Knight’s tactics had no effect. Even warning bursts from one of her two bridge cannons, which fire 30mm shells with the power to penetrate the hull of a small air or sea craft, failed to alter the pirates’ course or speed.</p>
<p>The cannons have a range of about a mile and can fire up to 1,000 rounds a minute travelling at 600 yards per second. Undeterred, the pirates returned fire using small arms and the cat-and-mouse confrontation continued.</p>
<p>According to the source, it now became clear that the Marines were preparing for action. They had just completed two weeks of intensive training for precisely the scenario they faced – an air and seaborne assault on a pirate vessel.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;In horror and disbelief, Wave Knight’s crew watched as a line was thrown from the Lynn Rival&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>The Wave Knight and the Kota Wajar were still some distance from the Lynn Rival and Chandlers, so there was no danger of the hostages being caught in crossfire.</p>
<p>Like all the ship’s military personnel they had been on a state of permanent readiness, known as ‘Alert 60’, for two weeks. This required that they could muster within an hour.</p>
<p>Twice that night, between 10pm and 1am, they went a step further. On each occasion the codeword indicating imminent action – Quickdraw – was repeated over the ship’s intercom.</p>
<p>Each time the Marines gathered quickly on deck, their all-black fatigues, balaclavas, night-vision goggles and carbines a picture of professional menace.</p>
<p>Close by, Royal Navy aircrew sat at the controls of the Merlin awaiting their start-up order. </p>
<p> </p>
<div id="attachment_127" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 384px"><img class="size-full wp-image-127 " title="Picture from the Wave Knight" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/pic6.jpg" alt="This picture taken from the Wave Knight shows the Chandlers' yacht drifting - and HMS Cumberland, which arrived too late" width="374" height="229" /><p class="wp-caption-text">This picture taken from the Wave Knight shows the Chandlers&#39; yacht drifting - and HMS Cumberland, which arrived too late</p></div>
<p>The ship’s gun teams – who are also armed with general purpose machine guns firing 7.62mm rounds at up to 950 per minute with a range of 4,000 yards – stared out at target areas on the Kota Wajar.</p>
<p>But on each occasion the assault team – part of the Royal Marines Fleet Protection Group based at Faslane on the River Clyde – was stood down.</p>
<p>According to our source the pirates, still apparently believing that they were up against a mere supply ship, appeared almost contemptuous when they finally drew alongside the Chandlers’ yacht and hailed the kidnappers on board.</p>
<p>In horror and disbelief, Wave Knight’s crew watched as a line was thrown from the Lynn Rival. The yacht was then casually hauled in and moored alongside the Kota Wajar together with the pirate skiffs.</p>
<p>Throughout this 20-minute period, the Chandlers and their captors could be fleetingly glimpsed as shadows and silhouettes in the supply ship’s searchlight.</p>
<p>Although the Wave Knight remained darkened, it is inconceivable that the couple could have mistaken it for anything other than a naval vessel and perhaps dared to hope a rescue was imminent.</p>
<p>In the sweltering night, illuminated only by the stars and sweeps of the Wave Knight’s searchlights, the Chandlers could be seen climbing a ladder on the side of the Kota Wajar, with pirate guards above and below them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-128" title="Time line of attempted rescue of Paul and Rachel Chandler" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/pic7.jpg" alt="pic7" width="421" height="388" /></p>
<p>Then they disappeared into the ship’s hull. The Kota Wajar turned and steamed slowly north with its hostages.</p>
<p>It was, according to our source, a surreal moment. Having been feet away, poised for a dramatic rescue, some of the world’s most feared fighting troops were now being ordered to pack their kit and go to bed.</p>
<p>A pursuit of the Kota Wajar was, apparently, deemed pointless.</p>
<p>The source added: ‘The mood among the Marines was one of intense anger and frustration. These guys were right up for it – absolutely champing at the bit. It was precisely the situation they had trained for.</p>
<p>‘We had all watched them practising rapid-roping [descending at speed on ropes from a helicopter] and sea-borne assaults. They knew exactly what to do. They were poised there like a bunch of Ninjas and the adrenaline was pumping.</p>
<p>‘They couldn’t believe the orders to stand down. The anger was obvious. I heard one joke later that they had all the gear while Northwood [UK command HQ] had no idea. We had a chance to strike a real blow at the pirates and send a message that you don’t mess with the Royal Navy.</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="attachment_129" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 384px"><img class="size-full wp-image-129 " title="Royal Marine" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/pic8.jpg" alt="Ready for action: Royal Marines were poised to stage a dramatic rescue but were stood down" width="374" height="282" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ready for action: Royal Marines were poised to stage a dramatic rescue but were stood down</p></div>
<p>‘Judging by its actions, the Kota Wajar had no idea who we had on board. They thought we were just a supply ship. There was a great opportunity to take them by surprise.’</p>
<p>The source recalled seeing the silhouettes of the pirates and the Chandlers being taken off the yacht.</p>
<p>‘The Marines were saying, “Now’s the time. Surely it’s got to be now.” But the order never came.</p>
<p>‘The Kota Wajar just sailed off slowly as if to say, “You can’t touch us now. We’ve got the hostages.” They knew they’d won.’</p>
<p>The crew member added: ‘The Marines were more than capable of seizing the Kota Wajar way before she got near the Chandlers.</p>
<p>‘At that time there were no hostages on board. You can argue that the Chandlers would still have been at risk from the pirates on their yacht. But we would have been in a strong position, having taken the Kota Wajar.</p>
<p>‘If the pirates had killed the Chandlers they would have had nothing and would have been totally exposed. It’s more likely that they would have negotiated a hostage exchange for their mother-ship and crew.</p>
<p>‘No rescue was without risk. But the Marines were in a great position and were never allowed to exploit it.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The crew member is unsure precisely what weapons the Marines were carrying. But the Fleet Protection Group’s standard issue includes SA80 assault rifles, SA80A2K carbines, MP5a3 9mm sub-machine guns and high-power 9mm Browning pistols.</p>
<p>It can also deploy specialist marksmen known as Maritime Sniper Teams, skilled at ‘slotting’ enemy forces from distance. It is unclear whether an MST was present.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;A 20-strong SBS team arrived two hours late&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>As dawn broke, the crew of the Wave Knight sighted their flagship, HMS Cumberland. The frigate had arrived some two hours after the Kota Wajar’s departure.</p>
<p>Between the two vessels the abandoned Lynn Rival drifted ghost-like on the breeze. She was eventually hauled on to Wave Knight.</p>
<p>According to our source, the Navy’s refusal to attempt a rescue of the Chandlers appears to have been at least partly influenced by plans for a covert operation involving HMS Cumberland and a Special Boat Service troop.</p>
<p>He says the idea was to parachute 20 SBS men from a military transport plane into the sea off the Somali coast. They were to be picked up by Cumberland – whose movements throughout have never been revealed – to lead a rescue attempt.</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="attachment_130" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 384px"><img class="size-full wp-image-130 " title="Paul Chandler aboard the Lynn Rival" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/pic9.jpg" alt="Sailing enthusiasts: The Chandlers are believed to have been captured by Somali pirates while sailing between the Seychelles and Tanzania" width="374" height="229" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sailing enthusiasts: The Chandlers are believed to have been captured by Somali pirates while sailing between the Seychelles and Tanzania</p></div>
<p>However, the source claims the plan went disastrously wrong from the off. He says the SBS team, assembled at RAF Brize Norton, was delayed for around six hours due to ‘unforeseen events’. By the time Cumberland picked them up from the drop zone they were at least two hours behind the action.</p>
<p>Wave Knight ferried the SBS team – complete with parachutes, arms and equipment – 1,000 miles north to the Omani port of Salalah. It was during this trip, says the source, that nuggets of information emerged from the SBS men in Wave Knight’s mess rooms.</p>
<p>They were, he says, appalled at the lack of flexibility among senior commanders to adapt the rescue plan and send in the Marines.</p>
<p>Within hours this sense of frustration was heightened further. The source says that en route to Oman, the supply ship came across another pirate vessel – little more than the size of a tug – which opened fire on them.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;It makes you wonder, what is the Royal Navy for?&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>By now Wave Knight had 20 Marines and 20 SBS soldiers on board – arguably the most lethal assault force of any Nato vessel in the anti-piracy operation. The pirates had no known hostages aboard.</p>
<p>An assault party was placed on ‘Quickdraw’ alert and expectation rose among the crew that at last action was imminent.</p>
<p>Our source said: ‘We thought it was inevitable. Pirates had fired first at a Royal Navy ship. If this doesn’t satisfy the Rules of Engagement, then what does?</p>
<p>The pirates wouldn’t have done that to an American ship because the Americans shoot back – with interest.</p>
<p>We had all the firepower and expertise we needed several times over. Yet again the order came to stand down. It makes you wonder, what is the Royal Navy for?’</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="attachment_131" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 384px"><img class="size-full wp-image-131 " title="Lynn Rival" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/pic10.jpg" alt="Deserted: The Chandlers' 38ft yacht Lynn Rival, pictured here being fixed before their ill-fated trip, was found abandoned by Royal Navy forces patrolling the pirate-infested waters off Somalia" width="374" height="258" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Deserted: The Chandlers&#39; 38ft yacht Lynn Rival, pictured here being fixed before their ill-fated trip, was found abandoned by Royal Navy forces patrolling the pirate-infested waters off Somalia</p></div>
<p>The SBS force was flown off Wave Knight by helicopter on November 1, landing in Salalah. A military transport plane immediately returned them to the UK.</p>
<p>Frustration among Wave Knight’s crew was not lost on senior commanders and early that morning Captain Clarke included a long, personal communique to the entire company in his Daily Orders.</p>
<p>The document confirms the presence of Royal Marines but refers to the SBS only as ‘embarked forces’. It is headed: ‘Command Aim TLC [Tender Loving Care] for embarked forces and make preparations for the safe and timely disembarkation of RM [Royal Marine] passengers and 814 Sqn Det [Merlin helicopter crew].’</p>
<p>The captain passed on congratulations from commanders at Northwood, near London, the Navy’s operational HQ and home of the Armed Forces Permanent Joint Headquarters, which controls all UK overseas operations.</p>
<p>They emphasised that the ship’s conduct was a ‘success story’, despite Northwood’s refusal to sanction a Marine rescue attempt.</p>
<p>After disembarking the SBS, Wave Knight headed back to the UK Maritime Component Command base in Bahrain, where 25 Royal Navy crew were landed.</p>
<p>The ship went on to Cyprus, where most of the Marines were dropped off for a week’s leave before being re-deployed or returning to their families.</p>
<p>She then returned to the UK, docking last Thursday in Portland, Dorset, with only her 75 civilian crew aboard.</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="attachment_121" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 220px"><img class="size-full wp-image-121 " title="Paul and Rachel Chandler" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/pic11.jpg" alt="Adventurers: Rachel and Paul had embarked on numerous trips aboard their yacht, Lynn Rival" width="210" height="381" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Adventurers: Rachel and Paul had embarked on numerous trips aboard their yacht, Lynn Rival</p></div>
<p>The Lynn Rival, which had been stashed on Wave Knight’s deck as our exclusive picture shows, was craned into the sea, then lifted on to a lorry and transported under cover to an unknown destination.</p>
<p>The Mail on Sunday’s revelations are certain to increase pressure on Admiral Stanhope to explain why he made an apparently misleading statement to The Times – an interview reprinted by other newspapers – on November 18.</p>
<p>His quote reads: ‘Two dead Chandlers would not have been good, and we wouldn’t have wanted to be part of that&#8230; It’s a huge piece of water and the fact that Wave Knight found the yacht was impressive, but we were not in a position to engage [the pirates]. We were too late for that.</p>
<p>‘You need special expertise to deal with hostage rescue, and we didn’t have that expertise [on board].</p>
<p>‘Sailors with pistols couldn’t do the job of ensuring the safety of the Chandlers. It was highly frustrating. There were broad rules of engagement that had to be followed, and it was a fairly easy decision to make because the security of the Chandlers was the most important thing.’</p>
<p>He added: ‘What could it [Wave Knight] do under the circumstances? Wave Knight is not a warship. There was only a flight [helicopter crew and engineers] on board, and as soon as they got close, the pirates threatened the hostages. They did the best they could, but the security of the Chandlers was the overriding factor.’</p>
<p>Last Friday he repeated his view in a speech at Chatham House, London, saying: ‘The sailors did a tremendous job in finding the Chandlers’ yacht in the first place. But once you have a hostage situation your military options, as most people would understand, are inevitably limited.</p>
<p>‘Had there been an opportunity to intervene, while being sure of guaranteeing the Chandlers’ safety, they would have done so. The decision not to was undoubtedly the right one.’</p>
<p>A senior Royal Navy source insisted last night that there were ten Marines on board Wave Knight, not 20.</p>
<p>An MoD spokesman said: ‘The First Sea Lord has always been clear that Wave Knight and those in command of this mission did exactly the right things.</p>
<p>‘As in all situations of this sort they had to balance capabilities and possible actions against the risk to life.</p>
<p>‘They did everything that they could in that operation and, could action have been taken, with a guarantee on the safety of the Chandlers, they would have done so.</p>
<p>‘Previous statements have only concerned detail that is already in the public domain, or would not be of use to the pirates we are trying to counter. We will not comment further on this detail. Discussing our capabilities in this way could reveal valuable information.’</p>
<p>For the Royal Marines and crew of the Wave Knight, those words surely carry a hollow ring.</p>
<p>As for the Chandlers, whose lives are being ransomed in Somalia for £4million, the agonising memory of October 28 is unlikely to fade soon.</p>
<p>They saw the Navy come to their rescue and then sink their hopes.</p>

<p>The yacht which British couple Paul and Rachel Chandler were on when they were abducted by Somali pirates has been returned to Portland Harbor, in Dorset UK.</p>
<p>The Chandlers are still being held for ransom for a reported $7 million, however news posts have mentioned that the pirates may be willing to negotiate for a lesser amount.</p>
<p>The yacht, Lynn Rival was picked up by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Wave Knight. The Wave Knight returned to British waters yesterday to unload the yacht.</p>
<p>According to members on the military vessel, the crew had been &#8216;forced&#8217; to watch as the couple were kidnapped by pirates. Military officials insisted the crew members could not have acted without endangering the Chandlers lives.</p>
<p>There were 75 merchant seamen and 25 sailors aboard the Wave Knight at the time of the abduction.</p>
<p>The couple were forced to change course to Somalia before being put on a container ship, the Kota Wajar, which had also been taken by the pirates. Based on videos released last week, they now appear to be ashore.</p>
<p>Mr Chandler, a quantity surveyor, and his economist wife have spent several six-month spells at sea.</p>
<p>It later emerged the Wave Knight, carrying a helicopter, was near to the drama.</p>
<p>A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: “Every effort was made by the Royal Navy and the international maritime fleet to locate the Lynn Rival.</p>
<p>“We did everything we could possibly do without further endangering the lives of Paul and Rachel Chandler.”</p>

<p>An article was found on <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,570845,00.html" target="_blank">Fox News</a>, posted November 1, 2009, that <strong>gives some hope that it may be easier to get Paul and Rachel home quicker</strong> <strong><em>and for less money</em>!</strong></p>
<p>According to the news post, Andrew Mwangura, coordinator of the East African Seafarers&#8217; Assistance Program announced he has been working with Somali elders to help free the couple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The (Somali) pirates realize now that the Chandlers are not rich people.  They will be persuaded to lower their demand, maybe to <strong>$165,000&#8243;</strong>- as quoted by Mwangura</p></blockquote>
<p>While it appears <strong>the pirates are willing to negotiate</strong>, the fact still stands that they are still being held with the impending threat of being killed if their demands are not met.   Some of you may not agree with giving into the pirates demands, however, if we can help these people escape from the region it will clear the way for the <strong>US, British and other governments</strong> to <strong>&#8216;get involved&#8217;</strong> to put a permanent end to this problem!</p>

<div id="attachment_67" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-full wp-image-67" title="story.chandlers.blog" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/story.chandlers.blog_.jpg" alt="Paul and Rachel Chandler" width="300" height="169" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Paul and Rachel Chandler</p></div>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Thank you to the people that have donated to the <em>Save The Chandlers</em> cause!</strong></span></p>
<p>As I have posted on the <a title="Save The Chandlers Facebook Group" href="http://www.facebook.com/#/group.php?gid=204931118668" target="_blank">Save The Chandlers Facebook Group</a>, I will be trying to get in touch with companies such as Google to see if they can help spread the word and find people to help with this cause.   Also, thank you to all those that have contacted me via <a href="mailto:SaveTheChandlers@gmail.com"><span style="color: #000000;">SaveTheChandlers@gmail.com</span></a> in offering to help.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2/1/2010: </strong><em>A LOT has changed since I first posted this.  The money will be going to the family and/or people that can help secure their safe release.   It became evident that this is a better route to go than getting an international company such as Google involved, which was my first intentions.  It became very clear that involving a corporation to help was not the best course of action. </em></p>
<p><strong>The money being raised WILL be used to benefit the cause of getting Paul and Rachel Chander safely home to their family and friends.</strong> While the British and American governments have a policy of <em>&#8216;no negotiations&#8217;</em> something MUST be done to help this kidnapped couple escape.  <strong>Whether the money is used to pay the ransom</strong> (which DOES occur regardless of our governments&#8217; intervention) <strong>or used to hire a &#8216;negotiations&#8217; team to speak with the Somali government</strong>, it goes without saying that <strong>the money WILL help the cause.</strong></p>
<p>If anyone here has any ties to the US or British Government Special Forces, I will be more than happy to talk with them AND offer some names of people that have volunteered to go to Somalia and work on this problem.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for all your support and <strong>PLEASE keep spreading the word and sending in donations</strong>.  With each dollar raised, Paul and Rachel Chandler are that much closer to coming home!</p>
