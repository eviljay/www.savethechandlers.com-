			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The stats are showing that the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=204931118668" target="_blank">FaceBook group dedicated to Paul and Rachel Chandler</a> have more then doubled since last night at 11:00pm to 170 members.  This site has gathered some attention from search engines and concerned readers.  However, I am still looking for others to <strong>take over this blog!</strong></p>
<p>My goal is to help the Chandlers, however I cant do it on my own.  If you want to <strong>help Paul and Rachel Chandler</strong> obtain freedom from their Somali captives, then spreading the word about this subject (and posting blogs) is imperative!</p>
<p>I have no idea if raising money or spreading awareness is the best thing to do for this couple that was hijacked last month.  But, what I do know, is that if more people offer to help and support this cause then it WILL get the attention of the powers that be that can make something positive happen!</p>
<p>I cant stress this enough, I (or we, if I can speak collectively for the FaceBook group) need help with posting information about this subject until it is resolved.  I cant help but think that if nobody steps up to the plate and offers to lend a hand then the result will not be good for this couple.</p>
<p>Help today by contacting me at <strong>SaveTheChandlers@gmail.com</strong> or on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=204931118668" target="_blank">FaceBook group</a> and I will give you full access to posting on this this site.</p>
