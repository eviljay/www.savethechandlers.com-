<p>I just found the <a href="http://blog.mailasail.com/lynnrival" target="_blank">Chandlers website</a> that is/was documenting their journey.   Their last entry was &#8220;<strong>PLEASE RING SARAH</strong>&#8221; posted on Friday October 23, 2009.   According to reports, this would have been 1 day after the capture.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read through the whole site yet, however it appears that all was well until the last post.<br />
With the last message in all CAPs making reference to &#8220;Sarah&#8221;, I would assume that the Chandlers may have access to a satellite phone and were reaching out for help.</p>
<p>Sarah, if there is anything I, or this site, can do right now, please contact me at <strong>SaveTheChandlers@gmail.com</strong> As I&#8217;ve been mentioning, my goal is to help people like the Chandlers in coming to a resolution of this matter through the power of the internet.</p>
