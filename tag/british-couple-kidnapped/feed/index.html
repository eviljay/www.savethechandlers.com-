Thank you to the people that have donated to the Save The Chandlers cause!
As I have posted on the Save The Chandlers Facebook Group, I will be trying to get in touch with companies such as Google to see if they can help spread the word and find people to help with this cause.   [...]]]></description>

<div id="attachment_67" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-full wp-image-67" title="story.chandlers.blog" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/story.chandlers.blog_.jpg" alt="Paul and Rachel Chandler" width="300" height="169" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Paul and Rachel Chandler</p></div>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Thank you to the people that have donated to the <em>Save The Chandlers</em> cause!</strong></span></p>
<p>As I have posted on the <a title="Save The Chandlers Facebook Group" href="http://www.facebook.com/#/group.php?gid=204931118668" target="_blank">Save The Chandlers Facebook Group</a>, I will be trying to get in touch with companies such as Google to see if they can help spread the word and find people to help with this cause.   Also, thank you to all those that have contacted me via <a href="mailto:SaveTheChandlers@gmail.com"><span style="color: #000000;">SaveTheChandlers@gmail.com</span></a> in offering to help.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2/1/2010: </strong><em>A LOT has changed since I first posted this.  The money will be going to the family and/or people that can help secure their safe release.   It became evident that this is a better route to go than getting an international company such as Google involved, which was my first intentions.  It became very clear that involving a corporation to help was not the best course of action. </em></p>
<p><strong>The money being raised WILL be used to benefit the cause of getting Paul and Rachel Chander safely home to their family and friends.</strong> While the British and American governments have a policy of <em>&#8216;no negotiations&#8217;</em> something MUST be done to help this kidnapped couple escape.  <strong>Whether the money is used to pay the ransom</strong> (which DOES occur regardless of our governments&#8217; intervention) <strong>or used to hire a &#8216;negotiations&#8217; team to speak with the Somali government</strong>, it goes without saying that <strong>the money WILL help the cause.</strong></p>
<p>If anyone here has any ties to the US or British Government Special Forces, I will be more than happy to talk with them AND offer some names of people that have volunteered to go to Somalia and work on this problem.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for all your support and <strong>PLEASE keep spreading the word and sending in donations</strong>.  With each dollar raised, Paul and Rachel Chandler are that much closer to coming home!</p>
