			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past 388 days, Paul and Rachel Chandler have been held captive when their sailboat was hijacked by Somali Pirates in the Indian Ocean.  Almost a month after they were kidnapped, I was informed of their plight as I watched the evening news.   While the TV is often filled with horrible stories, this one seemed to stand out among the crowd.  I guess seeing a video of two innocent people being held at gun point really moved me!</p>
<p>Sometimes a person gets so inspired that they join a worthy cause so they can &#8220;make a difference&#8221;.   I felt compelled to help these two unfortunate people, but had absolutely no idea how.  After all, I did&#8217;t know them, didn&#8217;t know their family or friends, didn&#8217;t have any contacts in their homeland of England and certainly didn&#8217;t have any knowledge of Somalia or even pirates.  Not to mention, Im also almost 10,000 miles away.   So, I thought,  how could one person from California possibly help?</p>
<p>A few months before this happened, I had read an article about the rescue of Capt. Richard Phillips.  After a 5 day stand off with Somali pirates, the captain and his crew, along with their cargo ship, were freed with the help of the U.S. Navy.  I figured if I attracted the attention of the right people, this too could be resolved quickly.   Therefore, I thought it would be a good idea to use the power of the internet to raise awareness so people with more power than me would feel compelled to step in and offer assistance.</p>
<p>Shortly after I set up this site, more news surfaced about the Chandlers.  There were articles about physical abuse and possible executions if demands weren&#8217;t immediately met.    Amidst all the reports, different figures were published as to the amount of the ransom being requested by the pirates.  As I was posting these news articles, the site gained in popularity and attracted more attention that I had anticipated.</p>
<p>On quite a few occasions, I fielded emails from both soldier-of-fortune wannabes and legitimate organizations that were actually qualified to help, albeit for a hefty daily fee.  I was also contacted by quite a few people asking the same question, &#8220;What can I do to help?&#8221;.  While it looked like my idea of raising awareness had worked, I began to notice something else which was rather disturbing.  It appeared that the pirates were trying to use the media to help increase the Chandlers&#8217; &#8220;value&#8221; and in turn the amount of their ransom demand.  When I discovered this, I realized that posting all the news that was floating around the internet wasn&#8217;t such a good idea.  I was also convinced, by some well known organizations who deal with this type of activity all the time, that I should be very careful about what I say.   After all, the last thing I wanted to do was is to make matters worse so I took <em>some</em> of their advice.</p>
<p>Well, its been 388 days and Im pleased to say:</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;font-size:16px;">PAUL AND RACHEL CHANDLER ARE FINALLY FREE!!!</span></p>
<p>Im sure Paul &amp; Rachel, their family and the viewers of this site are also excited to hear this news!  I wish the Chandlers a very happy homecoming and hope they can resume their lives quickly.</p>
<p>For those of you that were also compelled to offer your support through private emails and contributions, THANK YOU!   As for the money this site raised, while it was an <em>extremely small amount</em>, it was still successfully used as it was to be intended.</p>
<p>As for who I am now that this is finally over, well, lets just say that Im just an average guy named Scott from California who has learned quite a bit during this journey!  I&#8217;ve met amazing people along the way and have been enlightened by some of the injustice that occurs outside my countries borders.  And, when all that can be revealed is published, I hope that my efforts did more good than harm at helping 2 strangers Ive never met secure their freedom.</p>

<blockquote><p>What happened to the money counter on the website? This concerns me…I hope the small funds have gone to paying the Chandler’s ransom. I hope this isn’t a ripoff! Damn, I so want them to be released!</p></blockquote>
<p>I figure I would answer it publicly because there may be others (including the gracious people who have donated) that are curious as well.</p>
<p>It was brought to my attention by a professional who has worked with many of these cases that displaying this information may not be helpful during possible negotiations.  My intentions are nothing less than helping Paul and Rachel get back to their families so I will avoid doing anything that might jeopardize this cause!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Her face is gaunt and drawn, her frame skeletal and weak.</p>
<p>The shocking effects of captivity are all too clear in this picture of Rachel Chandler, who has been held by Somali pirates for the last three months.</p>
<p>The image was taken by a French news agency that was allowed to accompany a doctor who examined Mrs Chandler and her husband Paul, who are being held separately.</p>
<div id="attachment_207" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 478px"><img class="size-full wp-image-207" title="Photo of Rachel Chandler at a location in central Somalia, where she is being held by pirates" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/article-0-0818ED80000005DC-935_468x765.jpg" alt="Photo of Rachel Chandler at a location in central Somalia, where she is being held by pirates" width="468" height="765" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo of Rachel Chandler at a location in central Somalia, where she is being held by pirates</p></div>
<p>The strain on 56-year-old Mrs Chandler’s face is clearly visible as she sits with her dress hanging loosely from her thin shoulders.</p>
<p>Yesterday she renewed her plea for urgent help, saying: ‘We have not much time left and are being badly treated. Please help us – these people are not treating us well.’</p>
<p>She went on: ‘I’m old, I’m 56, and my husband is 60 years old. We need to be together because we have not much time left. These people are treating us so cruelly.’</p>
<p>This is only the second time Mrs Chandler, an economist, has been seen since she and her husband were kidnapped in October at gunpoint as they sailed in their yacht towards Tanzania.</p>
<p>The last time was in November, when a video taken by the kidnappers – who are demanding a £1.9million ransom – was shown on Channel 4.</p>
<div id="attachment_208" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 478px"><img class="size-full wp-image-208" title="Mrs Chandler" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/article-0-08190397000005DC-35_468x313.jpg" alt="Mrs Chandler being examined by Somali doctor Abdi Mohamed Helmi at a location in central Somalia" width="468" height="313" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mrs Chandler being examined by Somali doctor Abdi Mohamed Helmi at a location in central Somalia</p></div>
<p>They have made other pleas for help in desperate phone calls, most recently on January 21, but the physical deterioration in yesterday’s new images are clear.</p>
<p>The Somalian doctor who examined Mrs Chandler said she was suffering a heavy ‘ mental’ toll as well, which was manifested in ‘insomnia’.</p>
<p>Surgeon Mohamed Helmi Hangul, who spent three weeks securing permission to visit the couple, said she was ‘mentally ill’, ‘anxious’, ‘disorientated’ and had been asking repeatedly for her husband.</p>
<p>Mr Chandler also appeared gaunt in the video taken last Thursday but released last night. His ribs could be seen as he lifted his shirt to be checked by the doctor, who reported he had a cough and a fever.</p>
<div id="attachment_209" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 478px"><img class="size-full wp-image-209" title="Paul Chandler examined by somali doctor" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/article-0-0818F975000005DC-459_468x662.jpg" alt="Paul Chandler is examined by the Somali doctor: The pair are being held in separate locations in rugged areas between the coastal village of Elhur and the small town of Amara " width="468" height="662" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Paul Chandler is examined by the Somali doctor: The pair are being held in separate locations in rugged areas between the coastal village of Elhur and the small town of Amara </p></div>
<div id="attachment_210" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 478px"><img class="size-full wp-image-210" title="Paul Chandler, 60, pleaded for help after admitting the conditions they were being held in were 'difficult' " src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/article-0-0818F18B000005DC-88_468x342.jpg" alt="Paul Chandler, 60, pleaded for help after admitting the conditions they were being held in were 'difficult' " width="468" height="342" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Paul Chandler, 60, pleaded for help after admitting the conditions they were being held in were &#39;difficult&#39; </p></div>
<p>In the video, filmed by the AFP photographer, Mr Chandler, a retired quantity surveyor, called on the British Government to intervene.</p>
<p>‘We are innocent. We have done no wrong. We have no money and can’t pay a ransom. We just need the Government to help, anyone who can get us out of here,’ he said. ‘Day after day and this is 98 days of solitary confinement, no exercise. I don’t know what to do.’ Mr Chandler finally pleaded: ‘Will somebody please help? The government or somebody else.’</p>
<p>Dr Hangul added he had not been allowed to bring any drugs with him but left a prescription-with the pirates. ‘I gave them some advice and told them, “Your hostages can die. All you want is money so treat them well, let them reunite”,’ he said.</p>
<p>Mrs Chandler’s brother, Stephen Collett, was too distressed to comment last night. A family friend said: ‘This is a highly distressing time for the family. They know the stakes are high and they are in an impossible position. The pirates want an unaffordable ransom and the Government won’t pay it.’</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211" title="The Chandlers time line" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/article-1247482-081AB209000005DC-316_468x489.jpg" alt="The Chandlers time line" width="468" height="489" /></p>
<p>There has been sporadic communication with the Chandlers since they were captured, although this was the first time a journalist had been able to meet them.</p>
<p>Eleven days ago Mr Chandler spoke to ITV news, explaining their captives had ‘set a deadline of three or four days’, after which they expected to them to ‘kill us and abandon us in the desert’. In a separate call, Mrs Chandler said she had been hit with an object she believed was a gun.</p>
<p>A gang member told the Daily Mail last month that the couple, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, would be shot by the end of February if they were not paid a $3million ransom.<br />
The Chandlers are being held in rugged areas between the coastal village of Elhur and the small inland town of Amara but are moved every 48 hours.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary David Miliband has already insisted the Government will not become involved in any ransom payments.</p>
<p>A Foreign Office spokesman last night said: ‘We are doing everything we can to help secure their release.’</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-189" title="Money_Back_Guarantee2" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Money_Back_Guarantee2.jpg" alt="Money_Back_Guarantee2" width="150" height="150" />While I know Im not the first to create a website to help innocent people escape imprisonment,  Im pretty sure this is the <strong>first time</strong> that anyone has ever offered a <strong>Money Back Guarantee</strong>!</p>
<p>Paul and Rachel Chandler were captured by Somali Pirates almost 100 days ago.  They are being held captive in exchange for $7 million US dollars.   However, its been reported that the pirates would be willing to &#8217;settle&#8217; with approximately $100,000.</p>
<p>This site has been created not to argue the merits of hostage negotiations nor figure out a solution to end the piracy problem.  It was created with the sole purpose of obtaining freedom for Paul and Rachel Chandler!</p>
<p>My commitment is to create a vehicle where by people can donate for the cause.  Im also committed to helping facilitate the exchange &#8211; money for the Chandlers.   If by any reason, the money raised by this site is NOT used towards the ransom of the Chandlers, then I WILL offer the donors an option of full <strong>MONEY BACK</strong> or they can have me direct the funds to the family on their behalf.</p>
<p>As stated in the &#8220;about&#8221; section of this site, my goal is not to make money from this tragic event.  As a matter of fact, I have already put several hundred dollars and a LOT of hours into this with my only goal of seeing these two innocent people escape their captors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Now you can help a cause <em>AND </em>have a Money Back Guarantee!</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paul and Rachel Chandler, the British sailing couple taken hostage by Somali pirates in October, are approaching their 100th day in captivity.   Repeated efforts have proven unsuccessful in negotiating their release.</p>
<p>SaveTheChandlers.com was created in an attempt to raise both awareness and money to help gain the Chandlers freedom.  Via many emails from concerned citizens and heavy web traffic, it appears that more people are following as this tragic event unfolds.  However, <strong>Im sad to say that we have only raised a little over $100.</strong> If each viewer would have donated $10, I wouldn&#8217;t be writing this post right now!</p>
<p>We all have our opinions as to how to &#8220;handle&#8221; this situation.  Some believe that negotiations with pirates only encourages more kidnappings.  Others feel that we should give the money and help Paul and Rachel resume their peaceful lives.</p>
<p>Regardless of your personal and political beliefs around this matter, it appears we may be coming up against a deadline for action.   Considering the latest news obtained from telephone conversations with the Chandlers, the time to act is now!</p>
<p><strong>Here are the facts:</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the valiant efforts of the Merchant Maritime Warfare Center (MMWC) and its chairman Nick Davis, they raised $100,000 which the pirates agreed would be enough to free them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the UK Government intervened and blocked the transaction so they could not make the exchange.</p>
<p><strong>What I propose:</strong></p>
<p>Since it appears that there IS money available and the only thing preventing their freedom is the UK Government, I propose a way in which the government <em>does not have to be involved</em> in the exchange!</p>
<p>The internet is a wonderful tool and should be used in this case as well!  By using a method of money transfer such as PayPal or even wire transfer to an account, we could effectively give the pirates the previously agreed upon sum of $100,000 US.    All they need to do is set up an account in their country and we can transfer the funds.</p>
<p>This can be performed in 2 stages so both parties will feel protected.  I suggest that we transfer $50,000 <strong>UPON Rachel Chadlers </strong><strong>SAFE release and confirmed passage back to the UK</strong>.  When she is free, we will give them the money as a way of showing that we are willing to complete the exchange.  The pirates will still have Paul as collateral that we will perform our part.</p>
<p>After her exchange, the pirates should be able to see that we are willing to work with them and eager to exchange Paul for the remaining $50,000, also for his safe and confirmed release.</p>
<p><strong>If you are someone who can represent the pirates, I suggest you contact me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are a member of the MMWC and still have access to the funds, I suggest you contact me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are a concerned citizen who wants to help (either through money or other support), I suggest you contact me!</strong></p>
<p>Once again, my goal is not to challenge the pros and cons of hostage negotiations, its merely to see that Paul and Rachel have a chance to live out their natural lives!</p>

<p>An article was found on <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,570845,00.html" target="_blank">Fox News</a>, posted November 1, 2009, that <strong>gives some hope that it may be easier to get Paul and Rachel home quicker</strong> <strong><em>and for less money</em>!</strong></p>
<p>According to the news post, Andrew Mwangura, coordinator of the East African Seafarers&#8217; Assistance Program announced he has been working with Somali elders to help free the couple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The (Somali) pirates realize now that the Chandlers are not rich people.  They will be persuaded to lower their demand, maybe to <strong>$165,000&#8243;</strong>- as quoted by Mwangura</p></blockquote>
<p>While it appears <strong>the pirates are willing to negotiate</strong>, the fact still stands that they are still being held with the impending threat of being killed if their demands are not met.   Some of you may not agree with giving into the pirates demands, however, if we can help these people escape from the region it will clear the way for the <strong>US, British and other governments</strong> to <strong>&#8216;get involved&#8217;</strong> to put a permanent end to this problem!</p>

Thank you to the people that have donated to the Save The Chandlers cause!
As I have posted on the Save The Chandlers Facebook Group, I will be trying to get in touch with companies such as Google to see if they can help spread the word and find people to help with this cause.   [...]]]></description>

<div id="attachment_67" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-full wp-image-67" title="story.chandlers.blog" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/story.chandlers.blog_.jpg" alt="Paul and Rachel Chandler" width="300" height="169" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Paul and Rachel Chandler</p></div>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Thank you to the people that have donated to the <em>Save The Chandlers</em> cause!</strong></span></p>
<p>As I have posted on the <a title="Save The Chandlers Facebook Group" href="http://www.facebook.com/#/group.php?gid=204931118668" target="_blank">Save The Chandlers Facebook Group</a>, I will be trying to get in touch with companies such as Google to see if they can help spread the word and find people to help with this cause.   Also, thank you to all those that have contacted me via <a href="mailto:SaveTheChandlers@gmail.com"><span style="color: #000000;">SaveTheChandlers@gmail.com</span></a> in offering to help.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2/1/2010: </strong><em>A LOT has changed since I first posted this.  The money will be going to the family and/or people that can help secure their safe release.   It became evident that this is a better route to go than getting an international company such as Google involved, which was my first intentions.  It became very clear that involving a corporation to help was not the best course of action. </em></p>
<p><strong>The money being raised WILL be used to benefit the cause of getting Paul and Rachel Chander safely home to their family and friends.</strong> While the British and American governments have a policy of <em>&#8216;no negotiations&#8217;</em> something MUST be done to help this kidnapped couple escape.  <strong>Whether the money is used to pay the ransom</strong> (which DOES occur regardless of our governments&#8217; intervention) <strong>or used to hire a &#8216;negotiations&#8217; team to speak with the Somali government</strong>, it goes without saying that <strong>the money WILL help the cause.</strong></p>
<p>If anyone here has any ties to the US or British Government Special Forces, I will be more than happy to talk with them AND offer some names of people that have volunteered to go to Somalia and work on this problem.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for all your support and <strong>PLEASE keep spreading the word and sending in donations</strong>.  With each dollar raised, Paul and Rachel Chandler are that much closer to coming home!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The stats are showing that the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=204931118668" target="_blank">FaceBook group dedicated to Paul and Rachel Chandler</a> have more then doubled since last night at 11:00pm to 170 members.  This site has gathered some attention from search engines and concerned readers.  However, I am still looking for others to <strong>take over this blog!</strong></p>
<p>My goal is to help the Chandlers, however I cant do it on my own.  If you want to <strong>help Paul and Rachel Chandler</strong> obtain freedom from their Somali captives, then spreading the word about this subject (and posting blogs) is imperative!</p>
<p>I have no idea if raising money or spreading awareness is the best thing to do for this couple that was hijacked last month.  But, what I do know, is that if more people offer to help and support this cause then it WILL get the attention of the powers that be that can make something positive happen!</p>
<p>I cant stress this enough, I (or we, if I can speak collectively for the FaceBook group) need help with posting information about this subject until it is resolved.  I cant help but think that if nobody steps up to the plate and offers to lend a hand then the result will not be good for this couple.</p>
<p>Help today by contacting me at <strong>SaveTheChandlers@gmail.com</strong> or on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=204931118668" target="_blank">FaceBook group</a> and I will give you full access to posting on this this site.</p>

<p>My goal is to somehow raise the funds or interest in people that could help.  I firmly believe with the power of the internet, WE can make this happen!</p>
