					<p>FREED kidnap Britons Paul and Rachel Chandler were seconds from being RECAPTURED by blood-thirsty Somali pirates, The Sun can reveal.</p>
<p>Brave ex-London cabbie Dahir Kadiye, 56 &#8211; who negotiated the couple&#8217;s release &#8211; told how a rebel group in the gang plotted to ambush the 4&#215;4 taking them to safety.</p>

<p>A former minicab driver who claimed to have masterminded the release of Paul and Rachel Chandler has received a hero’s welcome as he arrived back in the UK.</p>
<p>Dahir Abdullahi Kadiye, 56, was cheered by around 70 members of the British Somali community as he arrived at Heathrow airport.</p>
<p>He was handed flowers by a number of members of the group – some of whom came to the airport from as far away as Liverpool and Leicester.</p>
<p>The Somali Briton was reported to have negotiated the couple’s safe exit from Somali pirates who had held them for more than a year.</p>

					<p>The release of Paul Chandler after more than a year in captivity at the hands of Somali pirates was mixed with sadness as he learnt of the death of his father for the first time.</p>
<p>During his time as a hostage Mr Chandler had repeatedly voiced fears for his father, Alfred, who reached the age of 99 in June but did not live to see his son released.</p>
<p>On an internet blog on which they charted their adventures travelling in their yacht the Lynn Rival, they described spending much of the time at Mr Chandler’s home which they described as a “lovely place to relax by the sea.”<br />
In one of the last updates before their disappearance while sailing from the Seychelles to Tanzania, they posted a photograph of the sea view from Mr Chandler’s home labelled as “a reminder of Dartmouth”.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>For the past 388 days, Paul and Rachel Chandler have been held captive when their sailboat was hijacked by Somali Pirates in the Indian Ocean.  Almost a month after they were kidnapped, I was informed of their plight as I watched the evening news.   While the TV is often filled with horrible stories, this one seemed to stand out among the crowd.  I guess seeing a video of two innocent people being held at gun point really moved me!</p>
<p>Sometimes a person gets so inspired that they join a worthy cause so they can &#8220;make a difference&#8221;.   I felt compelled to help these two unfortunate people, but had absolutely no idea how.  After all, I did&#8217;t know them, didn&#8217;t know their family or friends, didn&#8217;t have any contacts in their homeland of England and certainly didn&#8217;t have any knowledge of Somalia or even pirates.  Not to mention, Im also almost 10,000 miles away.   So, I thought,  how could one person from California possibly help?</p>
<p>A few months before this happened, I had read an article about the rescue of Capt. Richard Phillips.  After a 5 day stand off with Somali pirates, the captain and his crew, along with their cargo ship, were freed with the help of the U.S. Navy.  I figured if I attracted the attention of the right people, this too could be resolved quickly.   Therefore, I thought it would be a good idea to use the power of the internet to raise awareness so people with more power than me would feel compelled to step in and offer assistance.</p>
<p>Shortly after I set up this site, more news surfaced about the Chandlers.  There were articles about physical abuse and possible executions if demands weren&#8217;t immediately met.    Amidst all the reports, different figures were published as to the amount of the ransom being requested by the pirates.  As I was posting these news articles, the site gained in popularity and attracted more attention that I had anticipated.</p>
<p>On quite a few occasions, I fielded emails from both soldier-of-fortune wannabes and legitimate organizations that were actually qualified to help, albeit for a hefty daily fee.  I was also contacted by quite a few people asking the same question, &#8220;What can I do to help?&#8221;.  While it looked like my idea of raising awareness had worked, I began to notice something else which was rather disturbing.  It appeared that the pirates were trying to use the media to help increase the Chandlers&#8217; &#8220;value&#8221; and in turn the amount of their ransom demand.  When I discovered this, I realized that posting all the news that was floating around the internet wasn&#8217;t such a good idea.  I was also convinced, by some well known organizations who deal with this type of activity all the time, that I should be very careful about what I say.   After all, the last thing I wanted to do was is to make matters worse so I took <em>some</em> of their advice.</p>
<p>Well, its been 388 days and Im pleased to say:</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;font-size:16px;">PAUL AND RACHEL CHANDLER ARE FINALLY FREE!!!</span></p>
<p>Im sure Paul &amp; Rachel, their family and the viewers of this site are also excited to hear this news!  I wish the Chandlers a very happy homecoming and hope they can resume their lives quickly.</p>
<p>For those of you that were also compelled to offer your support through private emails and contributions, THANK YOU!   As for the money this site raised, while it was an <em>extremely small amount</em>, it was still successfully used as it was to be intended.</p>
<p>As for who I am now that this is finally over, well, lets just say that Im just an average guy named Scott from California who has learned quite a bit during this journey!  I&#8217;ve met amazing people along the way and have been enlightened by some of the injustice that occurs outside my countries borders.  And, when all that can be revealed is published, I hope that my efforts did more good than harm at helping 2 strangers Ive never met secure their freedom.</p>

				<small>Sunday, November 14th, 2010</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE FAMILY OF PAUL AND RACHEL CHANDLER on November 14 at 1447 hrs</p>
<p>“Yesterday evening, we received the wonderful news that Paul and Rachel Chandler were to be released by the Somali pirates who had held them in captivity since October 23, 2009.</p>
<p>The videos that were shown on television earlier this year indicated that they were coping with the conditions and were in relatively good health. But we cannot yet be certain how the difficulties that they have had to endure in recent months will have affected them physically and emotionally. We would ask that everyone gives them the opportunity to adjust and return to their families and friends in the days to come.</p>
<p>Throughout the protracted discussions with the pirates it has been a difficult task for the family to get across the message that these were two retired people on a sailing trip on a small private yacht and not part of a major commercial enterprise involving tens of millions of pounds of assets.</p>
<p>Thankfully, common sense finally prevailed and a solution was obtained for their release in the last few days. There will be the inevitable questions of how their release was achieved. The family believes it would be irresponsible to discuss any aspect of the release process as this could encourage others to capture private individuals and demand large ransom payments, something that we are sure none of us wants.</p>
<p>The family would like to thank those in the Somali community especially, both locally, and in the UK, who did so much to help secure their release.</p>
<p>At 0300hrs GMT on 14th November Paul and Rachel began their journey away from the pirates by road. At approximately 0900 hrs (GMT), after a reception organised by the local administration, they boarded a light aircraft on the airstrip at Adado, for the first leg of their journey to Nairobi. They landed in Mogadishu and were taken by convoy to meet the Prime Minister of the TFG (Transitional Federal Government), Mohamed Abdullah Farmajo. This was followed by an onward flight, crossing the Kenyan border to safety and freedom, arriving at 1440 hrs, London time, their ordeal having lasted 388 days.</p>
<p>Both Paul and Rachel are in good spirits although very tired and exhausted by their experience.</p>
<p>They will now both have medical checks in Nairobi, following which they will fly back to the UK.</p>
<p>All family members would like to thank all the media who have respected the injunction for their cooperation and restraint throughout the ordeal of Paul and Rachel and would ask that this spirit of understanding continues while they are reunited with family and friends. The Family will not be making any further statements until they have had an opportunity to talk with Paul and Rachel on their return.</p>
<p>Paul and Rachel have asked us to thank all those around the country who have offered support during their ordeal and the professional advisors who have worked around the clock to secure their release.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Many people have been asking for an update on Paul and Rachel Chandler considering its been over 60 days since news was last released.  Sadly, the Chandlers are still being held captive by the Somali pirates with no indication as to when they may be released.</p>
<p>While we continue to remain focused on helping Paul and Rachel obtain their freedom, we are also concerned about the overall piracy activity in the region.   Since insurance companies usually settle these cases without much media involvement, the public is unaware of how rampant this situation has become.</p>
<p>The International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) is currently running a big campaign to fight piracy and to persuade governments to commit resources necessary to end the increasing problem of Somalia-based piracy.  Below is a link that will take you to a petition to help move this initiative forward.   Please consider signing it!</p>

					<p><strong>ITN exclusive: Paul and Rachel Chandler, the British couple kidnapped by Somali pirates, have used their first full television interview in captivity to congratulate David Cameron on his election victory and to seek the backing of Britain&#8217;s new government in securing their freedom.</strong></p>

<p>Paul Chandler, a 60-year-old retired civil engineer, said: &#8220;I&#8217;d like to say congratulations to David Cameron first. And as new prime minister, we desperately need him to make a definitive public statement of the government&#8217;s attitude to us.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the government is not prepared to help, then they must say so, because the gangsters&#8217; expectations and hopes have been raised at the thought of a new government and there might be a different approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>The retired couple from Tunbridge Wells were enjoying the yachting holiday of a lifetime last October when they were kidnapped by pirates in the Indian Ocean just off the Seychelles, hundreds of miles from Somalia.</p>
<p>They have been held for more than seven months and reveal on Channel 4 News tonight that almost half their time in captivity has been spent away from each other in solitary confinement.</p>
<p>At first the pirate gang demanded a huge ransom for their release, though they have since said they are open to negotiation. It is official British government policy not to pay ransoms to kidnappers.</p>

<p>An article was just posted by the <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/04/27/somali-pirates-take-british-hostages-on-the-run-115875-22214917/" target="_blank">Mirror</a> that stated Pirate leader Maslah Yare put Paul Chandler, 60, and wife Rachel, 56, into a car and hid them in a forest. </p>
<p>Al-Shabab, a group linked to al-Qaeda, had been closing in on the pirates&#8217; lair. Yare, who wants a £1.3million ransom, said they would be abandoned if Al-Shabab got too close because &#8220;our lives are more important&#8221;.</p>
<p>It has been rumored that Al-Shabab may have similar financial interests in participating in the kidnapping of the British sailing couple,  Paul and Rachel Chandler.</p>

Daily Mail<br />
March 20, 2010</p>
<div>
<p><strong>The text said British hostage Rachel Chandler had been shot.  But here, in a chilling interview, her pirate captors reveal she and her husband are still alive&#8230; but as far from salvation as ever.</strong></div>
<div id="attachment_283" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 478px"><img class="size-full wp-image-283" title="Rachel Chandler and her husband are as far from salvation as eve" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Rachel-Chandler-and-somali-pirates-11.jpg" alt="Rachel Chandler and her husband are as far from salvation as eve" width="468" height="299" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Rachel Chandler and her husband are as far from salvation as eve</p></div>

<p align="justify">Rachel Chandler shot. Please call urgently &#8230; That was the dramatic and brutally short text-message sent to us by our Somali contact last weekend.</p>
<p align="justify">And like every such missive about the British couple held by pirates in the Horn of Africa, it demanded to be checked.</p>
<p align="justify">The Daily Mail has the mobile-phone number for the gang&#8217;s spokesman, a lugubrious sounding character who calls himself Ali Gedow, and we immediately tried to call it.</p>
<p align="justify">But separating fact from fiction in this intractable saga is never easy. For one thing, &#8216;Ali&#8217; rarely deigns to answer unsolicited calls, and when he does his heavily accented English is rendered incomprehensible by whisky and khat, the pirates&#8217; drug of choice.</p>
<p align="justify">For another, one never knows whether to believe his rambling pronouncements, for the pirates have become as adept as Alastair Campbell at manipulating the media, to increase the pressure on those negotiating to free their hapless captives.</p>
<p align="justify">And so it was now. After reportedly confirming to a Somali radio station that 56-year-old Mrs Chandler had indeed received gunshot wounds in some unspecified incident, by the time we got through to him last Monday, pirate Ali had changed his story.</p>
<div id="attachment_284" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 478px"><img class="size-full wp-image-284" title="Kidnapped: Paul and Rachel Chandler were sailing around the world when their boat was hijacked by Somalian pirates" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Rachel-and-Paul-pic-2.jpg" alt="Kidnapped: Paul and Rachel Chandler were sailing around the world when their boat was hijacked by Somalian pirates" width="468" height="319" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kidnapped: Paul and Rachel Chandler were sailing around the world when their boat was hijacked by Somalian pirates</p></div>
<p align="justify">&#8216;No, it is a mistake  -  another girl was shot, not Rachel Chandler,&#8217; he told the Mail during our longest and most lucid interview since the Kent economist and her husband, Paul, were kidnapped while yachting in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p align="justify">&#8216;Two of our pirates had an argument, and one fired his gun, hitting a Somali girl who was with Rachel in the leg. Rachel was close by at the time but she was not injured. She is quite OK.&#8217;</p>
<p align="justify">In a bizarre aside, he added that the pirates have given Mrs Chandler a gun with which to &#8216;protect herself&#8217; from renegade guards.</p>
<p align="justify">Why would they risk this when she could use the weapon to shoot her way to freedom? &#8216;She will never do this,&#8217; he replied with a hollow laugh. &#8216;There are 100 of us and she is alone in the desert. She knows she would be killed.&#8217;</p>
<p align="justify">For good measure, Ali added that Mrs Chandler  -  who has appeared dangerously thin and close to breaking point on video appeals sanctioned by the pirates  -  is now much improved in health and spirits.</p>
<p align="justify">Her 60-year-old husband, who seems to be bearing up better than his wife, was also faring well, he claimed.</p>
<p align="justify">&#8216;We have given them books and a radio. They stay in a comfortable tent and they eat pirate food with us; sometimes we even drive them around to show them the scenery,&#8217; he said, making it sound as though they were on an extended holiday.</p>
<p align="justify">&#8216;If they get sick we give them herbal medicines made from leaves. They are not together any longer. We&#8217;re keeping them a few miles apart. But they are relaxing with our people.&#8217;</p>

				<small>Monday, March 15th, 2010</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>On Sunday March 14th, 2010, disturbing news was released to the media regarding Rachel Chandler.    Allegedly, she has been wounded by a small caliber bullet fired by a Somali pirate.  </p>
<p>I have yet to find any evidence that supports the validity of this announcement, so I’m not going to re-post the original story.  Also, as barbaric as this tragedy is, I haven’t found any evidence that the pirates harm their captives without provocation.    </p>
<p>Regardless, the fact remains that both Rachel and Paul Chandler are still being held captive after almost 5 months and we would like to see them rejoin their families!  Hopefully we will see some positive news soon!</p>
