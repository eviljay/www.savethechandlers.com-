		<description>we need to renew awareness for the chandlers.I just keep thinking if they were my mum and dad I&#039;d be desperate for more help.
I realise  how complicated and delicate the situation  is , and how blinkered these pirates are to the money.I just think that although we can all sit here and throw our two cents in,at the end of the day if that was your mother and father on that screen you could never feel the same about this situation.
They are ordinary helpless people just like us and they need to get a chance</description>

		<description>I think about this couple a lot and hope that somehow they realise that they have not been forgotten.  It is just not credible to believe that nothing further can be done by our Government or others to bring about the release of Paul and Rachel Chandler or is it?.  I would be very happy to start/join a campaign to bring the Chandlers&#039; plight back into the public eye and help renew awareness of their terrible ordeal.   I don&#039;t know how to go about starting such a campaign (there may exist one already?) and it would, in any case, need a lot of support from ordinary people who perhaps like me, are non political but quite appalled at the apparent lack of action by the previous and present Government to secure the release of the Chandlers.</description>

		<description>Mr and Mrs Chandler have now been held for one whole year.  Is it not about time that the UK was reminded that these poor people are still captives?</description>

		<description>Why is there no publicity anymore?  If the Chandlers had been Diplomats, MP&#039;s, journalists or even minor celebraties, it would never have been out of the news.  A whole year of their lives has been taken from them and yet the past and present government appear to be silent on the matter.  Is it such a terrible crime for a person or persons to raise the money for their release?  Why aren&#039;t the press clamouring for their release? The Chandlers could sell their story to the press  for a substantial amount and pay their wretched captors that way!.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m so glad this site has been set up. What is their local MP doing to persuade the Govement to at least pin point where they are using the technology available to locate terrorists? It is a disgrace and makes me, an 84 year old ex Merchant Seaman, feel great shame at their ordeal.</description>

		<description>Dear Chandler family,
I have no way of contacting you directly and I do not know you personally. I am pretty sure You will know of my late step father Sydney Webb and my mother Mabs Webb-Allbright (who used to visit Dartmouth). You have all been in our prayers ever since the kidnapping. In August our family went to Gozo and at the church of Ta&#039;Pinu (church of St Mary&#039;s miracles) we asked for you all to go on their world wide prayers - praying for a miracle. We bought a mug from there and everytme we use it we send a prayer to Paul and Rachel and to the rest of your family. We hope they come home safely and well, to you all - soon. Warmest wishes and love, Allbright family. Malvern.</description>

		<description>I can&#039;t believe this couple are still in the hands of these outlaws.  I do think about them a lot and when I googled just now - hoped that they had been released and I had missed it.

What is our new government doing about it?</description>

		<description>Its shocking that more coverage hasnt embarassed the government to do more to release this couple,  time has moved on and the treatment they are receiving is like being in prison for them, it is high time a rescue operation is sent in.</description>

		<description>Imagine several of your neighbors coming into your garden and picking all your best vegetables, then dumping used motor oil on the rest.  How would you feel?  

Of course, for most of us there is recourse through criminal and civil court, but on a national scale, there was no recourse for Somalia when the world decided illegally fish her waters, and dump their toxic waste off her shores.

What recourse did Somalia have?  Her house was in shambles and she unable to defend herself from the wolves.  

So, what could the fishermen of Somalia do?  They could whither, or they could turn their fishing boats into pirate ships, and seek their own &quot;justice&quot;.

I&#039;m not apologizing for the Somali pirates, or providing justification for anyone who returns evil for evils received.  

I just want to point out that we&#039;ve made this problem ourselves.   As long as we the countries, the corporations, and the individuals enrich ourselves at the expense of our less fortunate neighbors we should expect, and arguably deserve, such results.
