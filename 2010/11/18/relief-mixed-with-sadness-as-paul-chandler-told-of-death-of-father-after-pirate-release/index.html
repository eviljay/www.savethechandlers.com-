			<h2>Relief mixed with sadness as Paul Chandler told of death of father after pirate release</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>The release of Paul Chandler after more than a year in captivity at the hands of Somali pirates was mixed with sadness as he learnt of the death of his father for the first time.</p>
<p>During his time as a hostage Mr Chandler had repeatedly voiced fears for his father, Alfred, who reached the age of 99 in June but did not live to see his son released.</p>
<p>On an internet blog on which they charted their adventures travelling in their yacht the Lynn Rival, they described spending much of the time at Mr Chandler’s home which they described as a “lovely place to relax by the sea.”<br />
In one of the last updates before their disappearance while sailing from the Seychelles to Tanzania, they posted a photograph of the sea view from Mr Chandler’s home labelled as “a reminder of Dartmouth”.</p>
<p><span id="more-347"></span></p>
<p>Another photograph shows the couple strolling along the seafront at Torcross with Mr Chandler senior, dressed in a coat and hat, resting contentedly on the sea wall, his walking stick loosely in one hand.</p>
<p>A caption read affectionately: “Torcross, after fish and chips with Pa.”</p>
<p>The former civil engineer, he continued to live independently following the death of his wife, despite suffering deafness.</p>
<p>But he passed away in late July, after a spell of ill health, only a few weeks after turning 99.</p>
<p>Although there was some contact between the Chandlers and their family through intermediaries, it was feared it could worsen their anxiety if they were told about the death.</p>
<p>Instead they were given the news shortly after their release on Sunday. In a statement they said they were coming to terms with their loss.</p>
<p>A video sent to relatives in Britain by the family during the summer as proof that they were still alive makes clear the level of Mr Chandler’s concern for his father while in captivity.</p>
<p>“They don’t care about our families whatsoever,” he is heard saying at one point.</p>
<p>“My father – I hope he is still alive I have no idea, he would have been 99 in June theses fellows don’t give a damn.<br />
“They really don’t think we deserve to have a family.”</p>
<p>In a statement issued through the Foreign Office yesterday the couple said: &#8220;We have just learned that Paul&#8217;s father died in late July, and we obviously need to come to terms with that.<br />
&#8220;We will return to the UK very soon.”</p>
<p>Relatives in Britain disclosed that one of the main hurdles they faced in their efforts to secure the Chandlers&#8217; release was the refusal of some pirates to accept that they were not millionaires.</p>
<p>Ransom negotiations broke down several times during the Kent couple’s 388 ordeal because pirate leaders refused to believe that more money could not be raised.</p>
<p>“Throughout the protracted discussions…it has been a difficult task for the family to get across the message that these were two retired people on a sailing trip on a small private yacht,” the couple’s relatives said in a statement.<br />
“[They are] not part of a major commercial enterprise involving tens of millions of pounds of assets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thankfully, common sense finally prevailed and a solution was obtained for their release.”</p>
<p>Pirates who hijack large commercial ships can expect insurance companies swiftly to arrange negotiated payouts averaging £2 million.</p>
<p>But Mr and Mrs Chandler had ploughed their lifesavings into their 38ft yacht, Lynn Rival, and had even sold their house in Tunbridge Wells to fund their retirement on the ocean.</p>
