					<p>FREED kidnap Britons Paul and Rachel Chandler were seconds from being RECAPTURED by blood-thirsty Somali pirates, The Sun can reveal.</p>
<p>Brave ex-London cabbie Dahir Kadiye, 56 &#8211; who negotiated the couple&#8217;s release &#8211; told how a rebel group in the gang plotted to ambush the 4&#215;4 taking them to safety.</p>

<p>A former minicab driver who claimed to have masterminded the release of Paul and Rachel Chandler has received a hero’s welcome as he arrived back in the UK.</p>
<p>Dahir Abdullahi Kadiye, 56, was cheered by around 70 members of the British Somali community as he arrived at Heathrow airport.</p>
<p>He was handed flowers by a number of members of the group – some of whom came to the airport from as far away as Liverpool and Leicester.</p>
<p>The Somali Briton was reported to have negotiated the couple’s safe exit from Somali pirates who had held them for more than a year.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The release of Paul Chandler after more than a year in captivity at the hands of Somali pirates was mixed with sadness as he learnt of the death of his father for the first time.</p>
<p>During his time as a hostage Mr Chandler had repeatedly voiced fears for his father, Alfred, who reached the age of 99 in June but did not live to see his son released.</p>
<p>On an internet blog on which they charted their adventures travelling in their yacht the Lynn Rival, they described spending much of the time at Mr Chandler’s home which they described as a “lovely place to relax by the sea.”<br />
In one of the last updates before their disappearance while sailing from the Seychelles to Tanzania, they posted a photograph of the sea view from Mr Chandler’s home labelled as “a reminder of Dartmouth”.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>For the past 388 days, Paul and Rachel Chandler have been held captive when their sailboat was hijacked by Somali Pirates in the Indian Ocean.  Almost a month after they were kidnapped, I was informed of their plight as I watched the evening news.   While the TV is often filled with horrible stories, this one seemed to stand out among the crowd.  I guess seeing a video of two innocent people being held at gun point really moved me!</p>
<p>Sometimes a person gets so inspired that they join a worthy cause so they can &#8220;make a difference&#8221;.   I felt compelled to help these two unfortunate people, but had absolutely no idea how.  After all, I did&#8217;t know them, didn&#8217;t know their family or friends, didn&#8217;t have any contacts in their homeland of England and certainly didn&#8217;t have any knowledge of Somalia or even pirates.  Not to mention, Im also almost 10,000 miles away.   So, I thought,  how could one person from California possibly help?</p>
<p>A few months before this happened, I had read an article about the rescue of Capt. Richard Phillips.  After a 5 day stand off with Somali pirates, the captain and his crew, along with their cargo ship, were freed with the help of the U.S. Navy.  I figured if I attracted the attention of the right people, this too could be resolved quickly.   Therefore, I thought it would be a good idea to use the power of the internet to raise awareness so people with more power than me would feel compelled to step in and offer assistance.</p>
<p>Shortly after I set up this site, more news surfaced about the Chandlers.  There were articles about physical abuse and possible executions if demands weren&#8217;t immediately met.    Amidst all the reports, different figures were published as to the amount of the ransom being requested by the pirates.  As I was posting these news articles, the site gained in popularity and attracted more attention that I had anticipated.</p>
<p>On quite a few occasions, I fielded emails from both soldier-of-fortune wannabes and legitimate organizations that were actually qualified to help, albeit for a hefty daily fee.  I was also contacted by quite a few people asking the same question, &#8220;What can I do to help?&#8221;.  While it looked like my idea of raising awareness had worked, I began to notice something else which was rather disturbing.  It appeared that the pirates were trying to use the media to help increase the Chandlers&#8217; &#8220;value&#8221; and in turn the amount of their ransom demand.  When I discovered this, I realized that posting all the news that was floating around the internet wasn&#8217;t such a good idea.  I was also convinced, by some well known organizations who deal with this type of activity all the time, that I should be very careful about what I say.   After all, the last thing I wanted to do was is to make matters worse so I took <em>some</em> of their advice.</p>
<p>Well, its been 388 days and Im pleased to say:</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;font-size:16px;">PAUL AND RACHEL CHANDLER ARE FINALLY FREE!!!</span></p>
<p>Im sure Paul &amp; Rachel, their family and the viewers of this site are also excited to hear this news!  I wish the Chandlers a very happy homecoming and hope they can resume their lives quickly.</p>
<p>For those of you that were also compelled to offer your support through private emails and contributions, THANK YOU!   As for the money this site raised, while it was an <em>extremely small amount</em>, it was still successfully used as it was to be intended.</p>
<p>As for who I am now that this is finally over, well, lets just say that Im just an average guy named Scott from California who has learned quite a bit during this journey!  I&#8217;ve met amazing people along the way and have been enlightened by some of the injustice that occurs outside my countries borders.  And, when all that can be revealed is published, I hope that my efforts did more good than harm at helping 2 strangers Ive never met secure their freedom.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE FAMILY OF PAUL AND RACHEL CHANDLER on November 14 at 1447 hrs</p>
<p>“Yesterday evening, we received the wonderful news that Paul and Rachel Chandler were to be released by the Somali pirates who had held them in captivity since October 23, 2009.</p>
<p>The videos that were shown on television earlier this year indicated that they were coping with the conditions and were in relatively good health. But we cannot yet be certain how the difficulties that they have had to endure in recent months will have affected them physically and emotionally. We would ask that everyone gives them the opportunity to adjust and return to their families and friends in the days to come.</p>
<p>Throughout the protracted discussions with the pirates it has been a difficult task for the family to get across the message that these were two retired people on a sailing trip on a small private yacht and not part of a major commercial enterprise involving tens of millions of pounds of assets.</p>
<p>Thankfully, common sense finally prevailed and a solution was obtained for their release in the last few days. There will be the inevitable questions of how their release was achieved. The family believes it would be irresponsible to discuss any aspect of the release process as this could encourage others to capture private individuals and demand large ransom payments, something that we are sure none of us wants.</p>
<p>The family would like to thank those in the Somali community especially, both locally, and in the UK, who did so much to help secure their release.</p>
<p>At 0300hrs GMT on 14th November Paul and Rachel began their journey away from the pirates by road. At approximately 0900 hrs (GMT), after a reception organised by the local administration, they boarded a light aircraft on the airstrip at Adado, for the first leg of their journey to Nairobi. They landed in Mogadishu and were taken by convoy to meet the Prime Minister of the TFG (Transitional Federal Government), Mohamed Abdullah Farmajo. This was followed by an onward flight, crossing the Kenyan border to safety and freedom, arriving at 1440 hrs, London time, their ordeal having lasted 388 days.</p>
<p>Both Paul and Rachel are in good spirits although very tired and exhausted by their experience.</p>
<p>They will now both have medical checks in Nairobi, following which they will fly back to the UK.</p>
<p>All family members would like to thank all the media who have respected the injunction for their cooperation and restraint throughout the ordeal of Paul and Rachel and would ask that this spirit of understanding continues while they are reunited with family and friends. The Family will not be making any further statements until they have had an opportunity to talk with Paul and Rachel on their return.</p>
<p>Paul and Rachel have asked us to thank all those around the country who have offered support during their ordeal and the professional advisors who have worked around the clock to secure their release.</p>
