				<p>FREED kidnap Britons Paul and Rachel Chandler were seconds from being RECAPTURED by blood-thirsty Somali pirates, The Sun can reveal.</p>
<p>Brave ex-London cabbie Dahir Kadiye, 56 &#8211; who negotiated the couple&#8217;s release &#8211; told how a rebel group in the gang plotted to ambush the 4&#215;4 taking them to safety.</p>
<div id="attachment_363" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><img src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Cabbie-Dahir-Kadiye.png" alt="ex-London cabbie who helped Paul and Rachel Chandler escape Somali pirates" title="Cabbie Dahir Kadiye" width="400" height="235" class="size-full wp-image-363" /><p class="wp-caption-text">ex-London cabbie who helped Paul and Rachel Chandler escape Somali pirates</p></div>
<p>The breakaway bandits intended to shoot dead their former comrades and demand a SECOND ransom for Dahir and the Chandlers.</p>
<p>In a gripping exclusive interview, Dahir wept as he recalled his despair as last week&#8217;s secret mission teetered on the edge of disaster.<br />
<span id="more-361"></span><br />
He had already endured a terrifying ten-hour wait, during which one of the 15 pirates threatened to blow his head off, before he was taken in darkness to a bush camp where the frightened couple had been held for 388 days.</p>
<p>After embracing, Dahir, Paul and Rachel were packed into a jeep for the dangerous drive to Mogadishu, capital of war-torn Somalia.</p>
<div id="attachment_373" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><img src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Escape-SUV.png" alt="Paul and Rachel board climb into a vehicle last week as their nightmare nears its end in dramatic dawn hand over to ex-cabbie Dahir" title="Escape SUV" width="400" height="234" class="size-full wp-image-373" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Paul and Rachel board climb into a vehicle last week as their nightmare nears its end in dramatic dawn hand over to ex-cabbie Dahir</p></div>
<p>&#8220;During the journey, word reached us that the rebels planned to hijack our vehicle, kidnap all three of us and shoot dead their four fellow pirates.</p>
<p>&#8220;I screamed, &#8216;Oh no, this can&#8217;t be happening&#8217;. It was a nightmare scenario. I hadn&#8217;t gone all that way to Africa to end up as a hostage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rachel and Paul looked mortified. I ordered our driver, &#8216;Do something. You better do something&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;He then performed a diversion along a side road to avoid the ambush we knew was on the road ahead. Even after the detour, we could never be sure we were safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Somali-born Dahir flew from his home in Leytonstone, East London, to win freedom for the Chandlers.</p>
<p>Retired civil engineer Paul, 60, and former economist Rachel, 57, were seized in October 2009 from their 38ft yacht the Lynn Rival as they sailed off the Seychelles.</p>
<p>The pirates threatened to kill them unless a ransom was paid.</p>
<p>After watching emotional TV appeals for their release, Dahir&#8217;s sons Yusuf, 16, and Liban, 26, urged him to do something.</p>
<p>The former asylum seeker spoke to clan elders in Adado &#8211; the village where he grew up, which is close to the pirates&#8217; lair.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a ransom deal had been set up. Relatives of the Chandlers, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, had earlier arranged for around £282,000 to be dropped from a plane off the coast of Somalia.</p>
<p>The pirates refused to release the couple and upped their demand.</p>
<p>A second payment of around £219,000 raised by the Somali community was dropped near Adado hours before the couple were freed.</p>
<p>On Saturday, November 13, Dahir set off with doctors and elders in a seven-vehicle convoy to collect the hostages.</p>
<p>But they were intercepted by the pirates and found themselves out-gunned and outnumbered.</p>
<p>Dahir choked back tears as he recalled: &#8220;I had armed guards because you cannot trust anyone. We were ten kilometres (six miles) from the Chandlers when pirates appeared and demanded we laid down our arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a scuffle and they surrounded us, thinking we were going to take the Chandlers by force before they got the ransom.</p>
<div id="attachment_379" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><img src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Paul-and-Rachel-Chandler-released.png" alt="Paul and Rachel Chandler at Heathrow last Tuesday" title="Paul and Rachel Chandler released" width="400" height="234" class="size-full wp-image-379" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Paul and Rachel Chandler at Heathrow last Tuesday</p></div>
<p>&#8220;There were 15 to 20 of them and they had AK-47 rifles and Browning handguns.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ordered my team to put their weapons down and their hands up. I told the pirates my name and explained my family background.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of them piped up, &#8216;Only him&#8217;, meaning me. They wanted me to come with them alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of my doctors grabbed my arm and said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t go. It&#8217;s a trap, they&#8217;ll take you hostage as well&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I took the decision in a split second &#8211; if I didn&#8217;t go, I&#8217;d never get to see the Chandlers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on: &#8220;They drove me off into the dark. But then they panicked. They got me out of the vehicle and forced me to stand in the middle of the bush.<br />
&#8220;AK-47s were pointed at me. A rifle was put to my head and I was warned what would happen if I double-crossed them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was made to stand in front of them for ten hours from 7pm to 5am. I could hear them arguing.</p>
<p>&#8220;One said, &#8216;He&#8217;s double-crossed us. Let&#8217;s shoot him dead and leave his body here for the animals&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was too scared to move. A pirate pointed a gun at me and said, &#8216;You&#8217;ll be dead shortly&#8217;.</p>
<div id="attachment_381" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 395px"><img src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Route-for-kidnap-release.png" alt="Route brave Dahir took through Somalia" title="Route for Chandler kidnap release" width="385" height="311" class="size-full wp-image-381" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Route brave Dahir took through Somalia</p></div>
<p>&#8220;I started thinking about my family &#8211; my wife Zahra and the boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mission was so dangerous I hadn&#8217;t told them what I was doing. I&#8217;d said it was a business trip.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought about the good times, the birthdays, the joy on Yusuf&#8217;s face when Chelsea scored.</p>
<p>&#8220;By 5am, I realised I was either going to save the Chandlers or die.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally the pirates decided I was ok. I tried to walk but my legs were like jelly. I stumbled along.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I saw Paul and Rachel, we hugged and wept. I told them, &#8216;You are free&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were not yet out of danger as the breakaway group tried to ambush them.</p>
<p>But finally they reached the British High Commission in Mogadishu.</p>
<p>Dahir flew home to a hero&#8217;s welcome. But hero is not a word he is comfortable with.</p>
<p>He just felt he had to show his gratitude to Britain.</p>
<p>He and his family arrived in the UK as refugees in 1997 and were taken in. He drove a cab before setting up a chauffeuring firm.</p>
<p>Dahir said: &#8220;I saved the Chandlers to send a message to the British public &#8211; you saved my family.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have massive opportunities now and this is the payback.</p>
<p>&#8220;I also want people to know not all Somalis are bad. The Chandlers are good people and what happened was an embarrassment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dahir now hopes aid will be channelled into the country to stop youngsters turning to piracy.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;Most pirates are aged 19 to 25, brought up in a lawless country. For 20 years Somalia has been torn apart by civil war. All they know is how to kill and survive. Piracy is a living to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Chandlers agree. Rachel said yesterday: &#8220;People expect us to want those people dead. We don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those misguided young men could be helped if they had education instead of brutality.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke as they thanked everyone who helped in their release.</p>
<p>Dahir went home to a cup of tea with Zahra, 34, after his daring rescue. He added: &#8220;I&#8217;m not a hero &#8211; I just did my bit for Britain.&#8221;</p>
<p>His fee for this interview will be donated to the village of Adado.</p>
