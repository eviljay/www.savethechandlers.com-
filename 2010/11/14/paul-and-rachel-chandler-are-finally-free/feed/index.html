		<description>Very good question Maria.  Ive been hesitant in discussing details of the money due to the sensitive nature of this matter.  However, I just updated the About Us page on this site.  Feel free to take a look at it:  http://www.savethechandlers.com/about/</description>

		<description>This is great - but, what about those of us who donated money to this site to help?  What became of that money?  If it wasn&#039;t used, will be get it back?  Is there proof that it was used???</description>

		<description>In a previous comment I had said that I just knew they&#039;d be released, and discovered Sunday night listening to the radio that they had!  I couldn&#039;t help but cry!  I&#039;m so extremely happy and thankful to the Lord for protecting this dear couple.  How they were able to survive and still smile and be in positive spirits is only by the grace of God.  

Welcome back home to Kent when you return!  May your strength be a testament to the rest of us when we&#039;re going through tough times.  

god bless!! xoxox</description>

		<description>What fantastic news! And what a relief for them and I guess for those who have been following their story. I wish them well in their adjustment to &#039;normal&#039; life and their recovery from this horrendous ordeal. Lets hope that their experience and the media coverage of it will, in some way, help to stop this happening again!</description>

		<description>Good news at last.  The ordeal for Paul &amp; Rachel is not over as now they have to adjust to living with having regained their freedom and coming to terms with their experience.  I wish them well as they go through these coming days and months.</description>
