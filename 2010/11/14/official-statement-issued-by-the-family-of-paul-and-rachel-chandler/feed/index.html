		<description>A very warm welcome home to Rachel and Paul - you have been through so much. I truly wish you well in your homecoming and in your recovery from your experience, and that your future lives are peceful and secure.

I don&#039;t know how it all worked out but I did pray for you.  And I will again.  

All the best!</description>
