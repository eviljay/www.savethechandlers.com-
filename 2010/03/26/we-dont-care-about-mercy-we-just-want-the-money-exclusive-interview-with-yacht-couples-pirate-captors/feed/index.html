		<description>from Sydney Australia.
Only one question. How do you beat scammers ? You shut the doors lock up your phone and internet and go to ground for awhile and say nothing for a month or two or three. By that time the Militia will receive expences and release their prisoners safely . AMEN to that . Freddo. 

and I know what Im talking about.</description>

		<description>The British governent does pay ransoms and negotiate, behind closed doors, as do other governments, such as the French, Spanish etc. I worked in Afghanistan and there were incidents of international kidnapped personnel being released as a result of these secret negotiatons.
The FO is a disgrace in this case and is putting  so called &#039;principles&#039; above the sanctity of human life.</description>

		<description>I feel certain that if, given the opportunity, the British public were allowed to help this distressed couple, they would do so, without reservation.  It appears that our government are all but ignoring their dangerous plight.  Where has the bravery gone?  Ransoms paid to hostage takers are, of course, not a good idea because of further demands.  The alternative is to wait for news of Mrs. Chandlers death or deterioration so great, she will never fully recover, even if released.  These are not powerful captors with a political agenda.  There are no nuclear weapons to be deployed if we intervene.  So, what are we waiting for?  An imminent trip to London for an exhibition could very well see me knocking on Mr. Browns&#039; door with a few pointers on how to win the forthcoming election;  &quot;Show some &#039;fire in your belly&#039;; rescue this couple.&quot;</description>
