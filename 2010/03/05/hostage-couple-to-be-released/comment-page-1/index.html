			<h2>Hostage couple &#8216;to be released&#8217;</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p><img src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/s-PAUL-AND-RACHEL-CHANDLER-large.jpg" alt="Paul and Rachel Chandler taken captive by Somali Pirates" title="Paul and Rachel Chandler taken captive by Somali Pirates" width="260" height="190" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-20" />Relatives of the British couple held hostage by Somali pirates have welcomed reports that they could soon be released.</p>
<p>Paul Chandler and his wife Rachel, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, were captured while sailing from the Seychelles towards Tanzania in October last year.</p>
<p>Somali deputy parliamentary speaker Mohamed Omar Dalha said he was hopeful they would be freed within two weeks. He said that communities inside and outside the war-ravaged country have been working to negotiate their unconditional release.</p>
<p>Stephen Collett &#8211; Mrs Chandler&#8217;s brother &#8211; refused to be drawn on any details of the hoped-for release but said he was &#8220;pleased&#8221; by the news. He has been in contact with the pirates via local broadcasters and the Foreign Office, who have been working towards their release.</p>
<p>The Chandlers are among about 130 sailors held hostage in Somalia.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview with a Somali television station, Mrs Chandler, who has recently appeared gaunt in pictures, said: &#8220;I&#8217;m obviously very tormented and very, very lonely and worried.&#8221; Meanwhile, Mr Chandler described their forced partition as &#8220;torture&#8221;.</p>
<p>The British Government has refused to pay a ransom for the couple and called for their immediate release. The Somali pirates have previously demanded a &#8220;seven million dollars&#8221; (Â£4.6 million) ransom for their safe release.</p>
<p>In a phone call translated by the BBC, one of the pirates said: &#8220;If they do not harm us, we will not harm them &#8211; we only need a little amount of seven million dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Chandler, 59, and his wife, 55, were captured when armed men boarded their yacht as they slept.</p>
<p>It has since emerged that the crew of a Royal Navy vessel was forced to watch the Chandlers being kidnapped by pirates but military officials have insisted that the Royal Fleet Auxiliary replenishment tanker Wave Knight, carrying 75 merchant seamen and 25 Royal Navy sailors, could not have acted without endangering the lives of the couple.</p>

		<p>I am appalled there are no televised news reports regarding these people anymore&#8230;but sadly not surprised.<br />
I just want their families to know and trust we are always thinking and feeling for them; and wishing for their swift and safe journey back home.</p>

		<p>I go online everyday hoping for news of the Chandlers and everyday so disappointed.  If the British are going to block any monies to go for ransom why doesn&#8217;t someone from another country offer to cough up some money and get them out!  Keep the British out of it, I don&#8217;t understand.  Or, why can&#8217;t the British citizens route the money to a private bank then over to Somalia&#8230;.why does this seem so difficult?  It should be a transaction that could take about 24 hours!  I will never understand this one!  I do understand why the government is taking a stand on this, what a dilema&#8230;.</p>

		<p>April 22, 2010 is the 6th month anniversary date of their captivity.  I am writing their mp <a href="mailto:clarkg@parliament.uk">clarkg@parliament.uk</a> .  I have heard he was not re-elected, but there is no other contact.  I am also writing the Tunbridge Wells Counsil President <a href="mailto:roy.bullock@tunbridgewells.gov.uk">roy.bullock@tunbridgewells.gov.uk</a> to ask that they help in any way possible to help release the Chandlers.</p>

		<p>There is also a petition addressed to David Miliband.  I am writing an e-mail to him at <a href="mailto:edeelection@live.co.uk">edeelection@live.co.uk</a> asking for the government to help to immediately release the Chandlers in anyway possible.</p>

		<p>I am a South African who is very saddened to hear no news about the Chandlers. I would like their family and friends to know that I and I am sure many other people are horrified that no attempt has been made to help this couple. I am sure the British government can help them. Remember Dunkirk surely with all the resources you have at your disposal you can do something for your citizens.</p>

		<p>Even though the banks collapsed and the stock market crashed and everyone lost all their savings, and we have over 10% unemployment in the United States, I hope people will be able to help the Chandlers.  I am myself unemployed, but will try to help.</p>

		<p>We have also contributed to the fund to help the Chandlers, even with my unemployment.  We are fellow cruisers and hope to do our own circumnavigation someday.  We are Americans, and I&#8217;d like the family to know that folks around the world are concerned.  God bless.</p>

		<p>We tend to feel helpless because we don&#8217;t have the money or the political clout to help this desperate situation, and nothing much appears to be happening. But we do have the power of collective positive thought and visualisation. However unlikely it sounds, this has shown itself over and over again to be tremendously powerful even in apparently hopeless circumstances. May I suggest that those of us feeling concern take a moment whenever we think of it to send a current of positive thought and clear visualisation of the Chandlers&#8217; release? Just see them being delivered into safe hands unharmed. It can do no harm and might do a surprising amount of good.</p>

		<p>The Chandlers are in my thoughts everyday. I just cant understand why there is no media attension given to this &#8211; its as if they have been forgotten already or maybe is that just what the Pirates want?<br />
I don&#8217;t think paying money to the pirates is the answer .. they are oppertunists and as soon as they get paid they will move on to the next sailor in the area which isnt what we want !  I think the money should go towards employing some private detectives/ ex SAS military or marines in order to go track them down and raid where ever it is they are being held. Why hasnt this been done already? It cant be that hard? Its not like they are Bin Laden or something &#8211; they can be found!  At least that way they can be caught &#038; tried in court for their actions which is what is happening in the Netherlands at the moment. And hopefully with all these trials now taking place against priates it may curb the piracy and allow us to keep on Sailing <img src='http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

		<p>hello</p>
<p>to my suprise i see that my message is deleted ?  if you do not bother to contact the people who can help then its sad for the Chandlers even if its just for information as i find nowhere on this site a person who has the experience like whe have in Somalia or Africa regarding these situations if you did made the effort you could have my company name and track record with forbes 500 companys whose people i did bring back from Africa from 2004 to 2009 and that you can check !!! you must pop the anglo bubble and reach out for help al you do is talk and these two people are paying the price for it&#8230;you all want to go ..you would not survive 12h you must ask the people who do this for a living and dont worry about the payment if thats whats bothering you there ways enough to pay them with a secure uk person on the spot of your own choice all you need is pro&#8217;s to handle this case and there out in 7 day if a pro does it ,that is if there funds ready &#8230;its sad knowing who we are and you dont even bother to ask for info i lost my interst again in helping private people i hope you find the person to do it  but again shame on you all for not taking offerd help .. may luck be on them </p>

		<p>its shocking these people are forgotten,i can think of many ways to get the scum to release them,and to make sure they dont get a penny.Its a sign of the times in this awfull country(uk) that we care more about murderers than we do about innocent good people like the chandlers, this government, and browns shower should be ashamed of themselves.</p>

		<p>The CHANDLER&#8217;S WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN!  It is almost one year since they have been held.  I am hoping that there will be church service, a vigil of some sort.  I am hoping they will let us know how we can organize one in each of our communities.  Certainly every individual can help:</p>
<p>1. Send E-mails to everyone in our address book asking for their help<br />
2. Donate a little money,<br />
3. Join their Facebook Group,<br />
4. Send an e-mail to their MP (search for write your MP &#8211; Member of Parliament), write to the Prime Minister (10 Downing Street, London, UK).<br />
5. Sign the Petition</p>
<p>EVERYONE CAN DO ONE OR MORE OF THOSE THINGS!<br />
DON&#8217;T EVER THINK OF GIVING UP!</p>

		<p>Our hearts go out to Paul and Rachel Chandler and their loved ones.  I did not realize that the U.N. actually has an Anti-Piracy task force???  Wow.  It has become a huge problem.  I&#8217;m glad that the piracy problems are being addressed (I guess) but, how are they helping the Chandlers??  Doesn&#8217;t the U.N. have the power to rescue them?<br />
The Chandler&#8217;s story has been difficult to follow&#8230;not much info. avail. &#8230; but here in America we are keeping them in prayer.</p>

		<p>The U.N has indeed got the power and firepower to help.<br />
Sadly they appear not to have the guts or willpower, as this would probably mean bloodshed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile its pirates 1 U.N 0</p>

		<p>Idly trawling the web, I suddenly remembered I hadn&#8217;t heard anything about the Chandlers so googling for info &#8211; assuming they were now released &#8211; &#038; was amazed to find very little info!  Given this, anyone left in a similar situation would surely just give up hope knowing that the Chandlers have seemingly been abandoned by their country!  OK, they were pretty dumb to go where they went, but does that mean they should be left to die as it seems they have been?!  Apparently there&#8217;s a fund to help them &#8211; how?  Use the money &#8211; as someone else suggested above  -to pay ex SAS soldiers to get them out.</p>

		<p>My thoughts are still with you both and your families. I pray for those pirates that hold you, I pray that they will finally realise what they are doing is so wrong. I pray that God keeps you both strong and I pray for you safe and soon release. God bless you both.</p>

		<p>Often think about the Chandler&#8217;s well being. Difficult to know what to do. Feel helpless in the UK as no news feeds. Hope they are ok and released soon.</p>

		<p>My heart goes out to the Chandlers, their family and their friends of which there are now many worldwide.  I pray for their release and for someone out there to perform a miracle and get them released.  I hope they are being treated humanely.</p>

		<p>We are coming up to the anniversary of Paul and Rachel&#8217;s capture at the end of October. </p>
<p>We are given to understand that &#8216;things are being done&#8217; behind the scenes, but the oxygen of publicity will keep the pirate&#8217;s hopes of a ransome alive, and that Reuters June report was unhelpful in that regard. I hope that Paul and Rachel see it that way, too. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, if funds have been collected via this website, to whom are they accountable, and where are they now? It would be as well to say, as I am sure many people who would like to help will not do so without such information.</p>

		<p>Incredible how the news organisations have gone totally silent on the Chandlers &#8211; I suppose other news items are more interesting to the man in the street. Continuing to remember them and pray that they will be released soon</p>

		<p>The most important thing we can do for the Chandlers is to pray for them.  How absolutely terrified, lonely and hopeless they must feel so let&#8217;s stand in the gap and appeal to the Lord for a miracle. </p>
<p>How brave they have been in surviving this long . . . what a testimony to courage they have!  I am so humbled by their strength.  </p>
<p>You are not forgotten Rachel and Paul.  Remember that humans have free choice and it was their decision to do what they did, but the Lord has NOT forgotten you! He loves you and he will protect you, just in fact as He is doing now.</p>

		<p>the problem is that if a ransom is paid will they be released unharmed i doubt it, i have issues with the goverment we need to stand up to these people we attack countries that do not pose to many problems but when one of our own needs us we back down.<br />
they should send in the armed forces not just to relese the hostages as there are currently 122, but to show these people not to mess with us. however with this yellow bellied goverment this will never happen.<br />
another problem then exists any militirary action would probably see the hostages killed any way so sorry to say not a great outcome</p>

		<p>I believed because there was no news it was good news, wrong, both Paul and Rachel are still held captive and we hear nothing concerning their awfull plight. What can one do but sit and wait!</p>

		<p>The nasty British government have put in place a court injunction against the press reporting anything about the Chandlers. There is also a Super Injunction to supress any speculation about the CI.</p>
<p>I fear the Chandlers have been killed.</p>

		<p>Was thinking of the Chandlers today (strangely enough, while the rescue of the Chilean miners is going on) and wondering if there was any news.  I, too was unable to find much up to date information.  I pray that they are alive and healthy and that something will be done soon &#8211; very soon &#8211; to release them from this unthinkable situation.</p>

		<p>Watching the simply incredible, and unrelenting, efforts of the Chilean Government to release their trapped miners, it seems even more unbelievable that the British government &#8216;appear&#8217; to be no further forward in releasing Paul and Rachel Chandler. I cannot start to imagine what they are going through and hope that they have good news soon.</p>

		<p>I fail to understand why we no longer hear about this couple , as above says i sincereley hope that things are going on behind the scenes to secure they&#8217;re release , i am sure UK citizens would only be to happy for camelot to use lottery funds to pay for their release rather than pay for more arty persuits , i as a family member would be contacting whoever for help regardless of the governments stance.<br />
I sincerely hope both Rachel &#038; Paul are well and are unharmed and pray to god they will be released asap, god bless you both xx</p>

		<p>@John &#8211; how did you find out there is an injunction in place?</p>
<p>I was thinking and praying about the Chandlers today and came across this website. I would like to see the UK Government stop aid/assistance to other countries governments where British Hostages are held as leverage to assist with their release.</p>

		<p>Attempts to help the Chandlers have been blocked by the Foreign Office.<br />
I wrote to Nick clegg three weeks ago, who had little idea who they were!<br />
Only black and gay get help these days. If you are English&#8230; forget it!<br />

		<p>I cant believe after all this time that the Chandlers are still being held captive.  I was hoping that the lack of media coverage meant that the Ransome had been paid on the quiet and that they had quietly slipped back into the country.  My thoughts go out to the Chandlers and their familly, and i wish their ordeal to be over very soon.</p>

		<p>Tim Wookey &#8211; did you get any replies? I find it incredible too that it is so hard to get any news on these two. If it was someone &#8216;important&#8217; it would&#8217;ve been over long ago.</p>

		<p>Its hard to envisage what state Paul and Rachel must be in, after so long in captivity. i only hope that they are together as this will make it easier for them to endure.</p>
<p>If an injunction has been put on the press, then surely its part of an overall strategy by the government, working towards their release. Send in the SAS no good waiting for the UN to do something.  How they must long to return to  the beautiful countryside of Kent and put this all behind them. God willing it WILL happen.<br />
Our thoughts, best wishes and prayers are with you.</p>

		<p>I think this needs to be brought into the public eye again&#8230; I actually thought the Chandlers had been released. I am a professional yachtman and am appalled to think of this poor elderly couple still held against their will. Is there anything we can do to get a bit of focus on this issue again? Surely by now the Somalis realise it&#8217;s going nowhere?</p>

		<p>I too have been wondering what had happened to the Chandlers. I sincerely hope that there is a rescue process going on &#8216;behind the scenes&#8217;, and I pray that they will be safely released, I find it agonising that so little seems to be happening.</p>
