			<h2>Hostage couple &#8216;to be released&#8217;</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p><img src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/s-PAUL-AND-RACHEL-CHANDLER-large.jpg" alt="Paul and Rachel Chandler taken captive by Somali Pirates" title="Paul and Rachel Chandler taken captive by Somali Pirates" width="260" height="190" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-20" />Relatives of the British couple held hostage by Somali pirates have welcomed reports that they could soon be released.</p>
<p>Paul Chandler and his wife Rachel, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, were captured while sailing from the Seychelles towards Tanzania in October last year.</p>
<p>Somali deputy parliamentary speaker Mohamed Omar Dalha said he was hopeful they would be freed within two weeks. He said that communities inside and outside the war-ravaged country have been working to negotiate their unconditional release.</p>
<p>Stephen Collett &#8211; Mrs Chandler&#8217;s brother &#8211; refused to be drawn on any details of the hoped-for release but said he was &#8220;pleased&#8221; by the news. He has been in contact with the pirates via local broadcasters and the Foreign Office, who have been working towards their release.</p>
<p>The Chandlers are among about 130 sailors held hostage in Somalia.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview with a Somali television station, Mrs Chandler, who has recently appeared gaunt in pictures, said: &#8220;I&#8217;m obviously very tormented and very, very lonely and worried.&#8221; Meanwhile, Mr Chandler described their forced partition as &#8220;torture&#8221;.</p>
<p>The British Government has refused to pay a ransom for the couple and called for their immediate release. The Somali pirates have previously demanded a &#8220;seven million dollars&#8221; (£4.6 million) ransom for their safe release.</p>
<p>In a phone call translated by the BBC, one of the pirates said: &#8220;If they do not harm us, we will not harm them &#8211; we only need a little amount of seven million dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Chandler, 59, and his wife, 55, were captured when armed men boarded their yacht as they slept.</p>
<p>It has since emerged that the crew of a Royal Navy vessel was forced to watch the Chandlers being kidnapped by pirates but military officials have insisted that the Royal Fleet Auxiliary replenishment tanker Wave Knight, carrying 75 merchant seamen and 25 Royal Navy sailors, could not have acted without endangering the lives of the couple.</p>

		<p>I am disheartened to know that Chandlers are still in captivity. I am a Somali and do second Mike’s call to send UK special forces to do the job. I do not understand why UK government is not getting involved solving this deplorable acts carried against their own.</p>
<p>Please let me know how and where I can help to stop this insanity?</p>

		<p>I contacted my local MP Nick Clegg a few weeks ago but he had not heard of them!! Wanker.  Eventually I got the standard photocopied foreign office reply &#8220;we are doing everything we can but cannot go into detail&#8221; bullshit.<br />
<a href="mailto:office@ecoterra-international.org">office@ecoterra-international.org</a> say they are willing to negotiate apparently.</p>

		<p>i am just hoping that negotiations are going on behind the scenes and that they have found a way of coping. It is possible but very hard. I cannot believe that nothing can be done.</p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t believe that the government has literally abandoned this couple. They have spent their whole lives working and contributing to society- being good honest citizens just to be completely let down in their greatest time of need. I understand the government&#8217;s reluctance to pay off these criminals, but surely more should be done to secure their release. Imagine how they must feel knowing that their own country is doing nothing to help.</p>

		<p>what a wonderful xmas it would be for all the hostages and ships to be released<br />
by the pirates.<br />
I feel it needs someone with some real clout to get involved.<br />
let us have some suggestions and get them onboard.<br />
GOD BLESS THE CHANDLERS LET US GET THEM ALL HOME.</p>

		<p>Great news they have been released although details are sketchy &#8211; sky news claim a ransom of up to one million dollars was paid to the pirates to secure the release.</p>
<p>Just hope all the rest are as lucky</p>

		<p>Thank you Scott for mantaining this website.  We are sailors from Alaska looking to continue our circumnavigation by passing through the Indian Ocean.  Much like the Chandlers, we are in a 38 foot boat, sold the house, are 65 and 58 years old, have limited funds, but hope we have the courage to complete our facinating journey which is challenging even without the pirates.  We used your website to follow the coverage of the kidnapping and used the information to think about our own planning needed to cross that body of water safely.  Forearmed is forewarned.</p>
