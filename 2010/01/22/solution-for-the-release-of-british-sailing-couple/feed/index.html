		<description>Dear Mr

I can see good reason that UK Government blocked the payment of $100,000; even though it was raised and would have been suffice for release of the Chandlers.

Succumbing to the demands of these pirates, any financial gain would make them more intent to abduct other lonesome sailors.

The Chandlers were well aware of the pirates (blog) and dangers... http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/55429,news-comment,news-politics,somalia-hostages-paul-and-rachel-chandlers-are-authors-of-their-own-misfortune.

Pirates tactics are not of murderous intent, but are for the gain of finance in exchange for LIVE hostages. 

In realizing  the Chandlers are simply two persons without value to any company, it should become apparent to them it will be best for them to be released. 

The pirates are equipped with internet and realise that killing the Chandlers would have a detrimental affect on any future &quot;engagement of hostages&quot;. 

My message is to those who hold the Chandlers... 
Use your humanity and release these two people somewhere safe.</description>

		<description>Dear Mr 
               I was so relieved to find your site and donate, that you cannot imagine! I live in a small country in South America and was a sailor myself when I was younger. I learned the news about  the Chandler&#039;s kidnapping a few days ago through a friend in a Chrisitian website and I started to skim the internet to see what it was all about. I got into the Times Online and was horrified at the inhuman commentaries displayed there. So I wrote a comment suggesting something like what you have done, to collect money through the internet. That is why I congratulate you and wish you all the best and I will keep praying for RAchel and Paul. Regards, Susana Miller</description>
