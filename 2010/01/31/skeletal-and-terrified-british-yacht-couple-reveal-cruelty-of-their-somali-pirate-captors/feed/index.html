		<description>I am somalian living in UK for number of years, I am disgusted and ashamed the inhuman condition which Rachel Chandler and her husband Paul Chandler are being held.

These individuals have no money and they are not relataed in any shipping business besides they elderly and do not deserve to be treated like this. we pray for their save relaease as soon as possible.</description>

		<description>Hi, I&#039;ve donated too. I agree with Michelle that the pirates&#039; ill-treatment of Paul and Rachel is counterproductive. It is enough that you are holding an innocent and harmless couple, who are in poor health, against their will in uncomfortable conditions. To deliberately mistreat them and deprive them of their one source of comfort (each other) is obscene. I hope you realise that it is in your interest to treat Paul and Rachel well, because they are your only means of getting the money that you want.</description>

		<description>Hi Michelle-

I do have a counter on the site but it is not public.  I will figure out how to make it public sometime soon.   Also, thank you for your donation and words to the pirates.   Like you, I hope they are reading this so we can come to a happy ending.</description>

		<description>Do you have a hit counter for your website? I gave money via paypal and have been praying for the Chandlers safety and release. I want so much to see them happy and united. If the pirates are reading this: I believe you are risking your own safety by your threats to harm them and their possible death while under your care. I hear your rivals do not like the jepardy you are putting their much more profitable endevours at sea at risk for being foiled. Please let the Chandlers go and cease attacking private yachts. None to date have been profitable!</description>
