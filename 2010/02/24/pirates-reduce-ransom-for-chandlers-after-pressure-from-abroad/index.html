			<h2>Pirates reduce ransom for Chandlers after pressure from abroad</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-248" title="Rachel Chandler" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Rachel-Chandler.jpg" alt="Rachel Chandler" width="300" height="144" /><strong>Bartamaha (Nairobi):-</strong> The pirates who captured a retired  British couple four months ago have dismissed growing pressure from the Somali  diaspora for their unconditional release but are reducing their ransom  demands.</p>
<p>Speaking to The Times from the place where Paul and Rachel Chandler  are held, a pirate leader identifying himself as Ali Gedow rejected appeals from  the British and other expatriate Somali communities worried about their  reputation. “We don’t care about their pressure,” he declared.</p>
<p>But he made no  mention of the pirates’ original demand for a $7 million (£4.5 million) ransom  and suggested that they might release the couple if they can recoup their  “expenses”. He put those at around $2 million, claiming that they included the  cost of 150 guards, renting vehicles and food.</p>
<p><span id="more-242"></span></p>
<p>Even that amount appears to be  out of the question. The British Government has refused to pay any ransom and  the Chandlers’ family do not have that sort of money. But the pirates’ lessened  demands have given rise to hopes that they realise they have captured the wrong  people and are looking for a face-saving way out.</p>
<p>A Whitehall security  official toldThe Times: “This case is unusual. Unlike seamen kidnapped in the  region, the Chandlers are just ordinary holidaymakers without the backing of a  big company and the pirates may well be realising this now.”</p>
<p>Ridwaan Haji  Abdiwali, a presenter with the Somali satellite television channel Universal TV,  who has used his show to appeal for the Chandlers’ release, said that the  pirates would have put the couple up as collateral to borrow money. “Since  Somalis [abroad] began pressuring them it seems they are reducing their  demands,” he said.</p>
<p>The Chandlers, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, were captured  on October 23 as they sailed from the Seychelles towards Tanzania. Mr Gedow  claimed — absurdly — that their yacht was inside Somali waters and that the  pirates were simply protecting those waters from illegal fishing and toxic waste  dumping.</p>
<p>He said Mrs Chandler’s brother, Stephen Collett, called the pirates  almost daily to appeal for the couple’s release, but the British Government had  made no contact. If the Government did not pay, he warned, “they will never see  this couple again”.</p>
<p>Mr Gedow claimed that the Chandlers’ health was poor and  deteriorating, with Mrs Chandler, 56, scarcely talking and unable to walk any  distance. There was no need for the pirates to consider killing their hostages  as they would die soon anyway.</p>
<p>There is no way to corroborate those claims,  though the pirates did release a video in January showing Mrs Chandler looking  thin and frail. Mr Gedow refused to put Mrs Chandler on the telephone, though he  claimed that he was standing next to her.</p>
<p>He said the Chandlers were being  kept in separate locations near the coastal town of Haradheere in case the  British military tried to rescue them, and had not seen each other since a  Somali doctor visited them last month.<br />
He said that he felt sorry for them  but “those responsible are the British Government and the British people who  don’t care about these two. Other hostages have been released by their own  countries . . . Everyone else in the world is helping their own  citizens.”</p>
<p>The Government argues that it should do nothing to encourage the  seizure of other British citizens. A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth  Office said: “We are monitoring the situation very closely and doing everything  we can to help secure a release.”</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Chandlers’ family  declined to comment, but a letter released to the media earlier this month said  a continuing “dialogue” with the pirates was making progress.</p>

		<p>Where the hell is David Cameron in all this? Is he not looking to heighten his profile and improve his standing with the British voting public? Surely this is an issue that demands a tough political stance, to show that *somebody* can support British nationals abroad in time of need. God knows the current government in power isn&#8217;t willing or able&#8230;..</p>
