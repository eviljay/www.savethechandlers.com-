			<h2>British Government defends no-ransom policy</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>The Foreign Office has defended its stance of not paying a ransom to  help free a British couple taken hostage by Somali pirates three months  ago.</p>
<p>It issued a statement after an anti-piracy maritime group insisted it  should be allowed to negotiate a payment for Paul and Rachel Chandler.</p>
<div id="attachment_219" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 236px"><img class="size-full wp-image-219" title="chand" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/chand.jpg" alt="This picture of Mrs Chandler was released on Sunday" width="226" height="282" /><p class="wp-caption-text">This picture of Mrs Chandler was released on Sunday</p></div>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
The Foreign Office said concessions would only &#8220;encourage&#8221; future  kidnaps.</p>
<p>The Chandlers, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, were captured while sailing  towards Tanzania on 23 October.</p>
<p>The latest news of the couple emerged on Sunday. They spoke of their  ordeal through a news agency which had been allowed to send a  photographer when they were examined by a doctor last week.</p>
<p>The Chandlers said they were being badly treated and were in urgent need  of help.<br />
The pirates have threatened to kill the couple if their demands for $7m  (Â£4.4m) are not met.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Green light&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Nick Davis, chairman of the Merchant Maritime Warfare Centre, which  provides anti-piracy advice and training, said the Chandlers&#8217; captors  were running out of patience.</p>
<p>&#8220;The door is open for them to be released. Somebody needs to pick up the  gauntlet and run with it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the amounts involved, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth trying to bring  anyone to justice. We just need to get Paul and Rachel home.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the people who know what needs to be done, we can do it, we just  need to be allowed to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Davis said he could not do anything without the &#8220;green light&#8221; from  the Foreign Office and the Chandlers&#8217; family.</p>
<p>He said the pirates would need to feel they were talking to somebody with the authorization and means to secure the release.</p>
<p>A Foreign Office spokesperson said it had &#8220;never attempted to block any  activity by Mr Davis&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although there is no UK law against third parties paying ransoms, we  counsel against them doing so because we believe that making concessions  only encourages future kidnaps.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is why the government does not make or facilitate substantive  concessions to hostage takers.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Please help&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>The couple were examined by a surgeon on Thursday and Mrs Chandler was  reportedly in a poor state of mental and physical health.</p>
<div id="attachment_222" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 236px"><img class="size-full wp-image-222" title="chand2" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/chand2.jpg" alt="Mr Chandler was being held at a separate location from his wife" width="226" height="170" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mr Chandler was being held at a separate location from his wife</p></div>
<p>Mrs Chandler, who was being held in a separate location from her  husband, told the news agency AFP: &#8220;I&#8217;m old, I&#8217;m 56 and my husband is 60  years old. We need to be together because we have not much time left.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Chandler appeared in better health than his wife but was also under  extreme stress, AFP said.<br />
&#8220;I just want to say please, to my government, get me and my wife out of  here,&#8221; he said.<br />
&#8220;We have no money and we can&#8217;t pay a ransom. We just need the government  to help, anyone who can help us out of here.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Downing Street spokesman said the government was in regular contact  with the Chandler family.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prime minister&#8217;s view is that hostage taking is never justified and  we would like to repeat the government&#8217;s call that Paul and Rachel  Chandler should be released immediately and unconditionally,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are doing everything we can to secure their release.&#8221;</p>
