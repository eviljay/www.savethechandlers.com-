		<description>Rachel and I are friends since childhood and there are no words to describe how devastating it is to see her and Paul in this horrendous situation. When paying a ransom is not the answer or the way out, there needs to be a way they can be freed peacefully and without the pirates losing face.</description>

		<description>I cant understand why the family dont ask the public for help in raising this money.  It seems to me that the powers that be help everyone else in this world except their own.  I am quite sure that the good people of this country would come up to the mark and help this awful situation.</description>

		<description>Hello 

I would like to start with expressing how touched I am by what&#039;s happening to my fellow sail-mates, Rachel and Paul Chandler. However, no words of compassion can bring them home, nore can the expression of desire that they soon will be released.  Nore do I think that any solution envolving money in any way, it being at the core of the problem, will help bring this ordeal to a happy ending, unless it serves an indirect goal like paying for the transport of people to go out there where they are held captive. I presume, the Chandler&#039;s can be traced within a certain perimeter.

For what it is worth, I would like to share the thoughts I had a few mornings ago, while in my bunk on board my Rival 36. 

It is about the power of words, when spoken out loud and directed directly to whom they are intended.  In my woken dream, I saw a considerable amount of people demonstrating out loud, chanting out loud to free the Chandlers, so the hostage takers could hear it and were constantly confronted with it.  I saw the local Somalians join in, urging their brothers&#039; in high voices to release these innocent people.  There is no better pressure than social pressure. Imagine that the pirates, their faces, become known all over the world, that they are identified with this cruelty.  I therefore think it is more productive to put the pirate&#039;s faces on posters and the internet, than that of the Chandlers.  Imagine the world press and attention drawn on Somali&#039;s raising their voices while raising their brothers&#039; pictures.

In my view, as so much time has elapsed, I sincerely cannot imagine that the pirates themselves are not in an emotional termoil, an emotional termoil  I do not believe even the cruelest among us can handle or sustain for such extended periods of time. It could therefore well be, that a &#039;painless&#039; exit out of the situation they got themselves (till now unsuccessfully) into, is all they hope for right now.  

One should consider therefore how to offer them ,together with the Chandler&#039;s, an exit out of this predicament, without fulfilling the initial goals of their operation, as this will only endanger the lifes of future people. Money definately is not the way. 

I would like to express my deep gratitude for all those offering help and putting effort into freeing the Chandlers.  I do not know them, I only share a passion for sailing with them.  But they should know, that I carry them into my heart</description>
