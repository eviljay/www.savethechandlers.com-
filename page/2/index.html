<p>MOGADISHU, Somalia — A British yachting couple seized by Somali pirates and held in separate locations have been temporarily reunited after weeks apart, a doctor who treated the two said.</p>
<p>Paul and Rachel Chandler were suffering from severe anxiety brought on by their separation and captivity in war-ravaged Somalia, Dr. Abdi Mohamed Elmi Hangul told The Associated Press during an interview at Medina Hospital on Sunday. The two were seized from their yacht, the Lynn Rival, in October and have been held apart for most of their captivity. Hangul said the pirates had phoned him on Sunday and said the couple had been temporarily reunited.</p>
<p>“The two hostages were in different locations but I advised the guys to reunite the couple, because both of them were worrying about their separation but they now told me that the two people have reunited already,” he said.</p>
<p>Hangul treated the two hostages last month at the invitation of their kidnappers, in the camps where they were being held along the Somali coastline.</p>

<p>Paul Chandler and his wife Rachel, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, were captured while sailing from the Seychelles towards Tanzania in October last year.</p>
<p>Somali deputy parliamentary speaker Mohamed Omar Dalha said he was hopeful they would be freed within two weeks. He said that communities inside and outside the war-ravaged country have been working to negotiate their unconditional release.</p>
<p>Stephen Collett &#8211; Mrs Chandler&#8217;s brother &#8211; refused to be drawn on any details of the hoped-for release but said he was &#8220;pleased&#8221; by the news. He has been in contact with the pirates via local broadcasters and the Foreign Office, who have been working towards their release.</p>
<p>The Chandlers are among about 130 sailors held hostage in Somalia.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview with a Somali television station, Mrs Chandler, who has recently appeared gaunt in pictures, said: &#8220;I&#8217;m obviously very tormented and very, very lonely and worried.&#8221; Meanwhile, Mr Chandler described their forced partition as &#8220;torture&#8221;.</p>
<p>The British Government has refused to pay a ransom for the couple and called for their immediate release. The Somali pirates have previously demanded a &#8220;seven million dollars&#8221; (£4.6 million) ransom for their safe release.</p>
<p>In a phone call translated by the BBC, one of the pirates said: &#8220;If they do not harm us, we will not harm them &#8211; we only need a little amount of seven million dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Chandler, 59, and his wife, 55, were captured when armed men boarded their yacht as they slept.</p>
<p>It has since emerged that the crew of a Royal Navy vessel was forced to watch the Chandlers being kidnapped by pirates but military officials have insisted that the Royal Fleet Auxiliary replenishment tanker Wave Knight, carrying 75 merchant seamen and 25 Royal Navy sailors, could not have acted without endangering the lives of the couple.</p>

<p>Speaking to The Times from the place where Paul and Rachel Chandler  are held, a pirate leader identifying himself as Ali Gedow rejected appeals from  the British and other expatriate Somali communities worried about their  reputation. “We don’t care about their pressure,” he declared.</p>
<p>But he made no  mention of the pirates’ original demand for a $7 million (£4.5 million) ransom  and suggested that they might release the couple if they can recoup their  “expenses”. He put those at around $2 million, claiming that they included the  cost of 150 guards, renting vehicles and food.</p>

<p>SOMALIS living in Redbridge have vowed to do &#8220;everything in our power&#8221; to help free a British couple kidnapped last year by Somali pirates stalking the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Yusuf Munye, 34, of Chester Road, Seven Kings, is leading a united front among the borough&#8217;s Somali population in the push to get Rachel and Paul Chandler released.</p>
<p>They were kidnapped while sailing from the Seychelles to Tanzania in October.</p>
<p>Their captors have threatened to kill the couple if their demands for $7million (£4.4million) are not met.</p>
<p>Mr Munye said: &#8220;Some people think the Somali community in Ilford supports the pirates.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main reason we have come together is to show we don&#8217;t support them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are totally against their actions and we support our British brothers and sisters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Video footage released of the couple at the end of January showed them appealing for help after almost four months in captivity.</p>
<p>Last week, members of the Redbridge Somali community met in the Cardinal Heenan Centre, High Road, Ilford, to discuss what they could do to help bring the couple home.</p>
<p>Mr Munye said: &#8220;The government has said they won&#8217;t pay a ransom but we&#8217;re thinking about raising money to help.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re also talking about trying to make contact with these pirates to help bring the Chandlers home.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re able to talk to them or to others in Somalia, there&#8217;s a chance they will release them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will do everything in our power to free them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs Chandler, 60 and Mr Chandler, 56, are understood to have been separated by their captors and are being held in areas between the coastal village of Elhur and the small town of Amara, which is further inland.</p>

					<p>As Danish Special Forces stormed a hijacked ship and released the crew, the Somali Government has appealed to pirates to free the British crew of a yacht now held for more than three months. </p>
<p>Somali Labour Minister Mohamed Abdi Hayir, who is from Suleiman sub-clan of the Habar-gidir, and reported to be a relative of the clan who have kidnapped Paul and Rachel Chandler, said yesterday: &#8216;We urge the pirates to release the old British couple unconditionally.&#8217; </p>
<p>He made the demand during a news conference at the Presidential palace. </p>
<p>&#8216;We also urge the British government and all Somalis to participate in releasing the couple by whatever the means. They are innocent Britons in the hands of criminals,&#8217; he added. However, he refused to elucidate further on what he meant by the reference to the British Government. </p>

					<p>A non-donor sent me an email this morning stating the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>What happened to the money counter on the website? This concerns me…I hope the small funds have gone to paying the Chandler’s ransom. I hope this isn’t a ripoff! Damn, I so want them to be released!</p></blockquote>
<p>I figure I would answer it publicly because there may be others (including the gracious people who have donated) that are curious as well.</p>
<p>It was brought to my attention by a professional who has worked with many of these cases that displaying this information may not be helpful during possible negotiations.  My intentions are nothing less than helping Paul and Rachel get back to their families so I will avoid doing anything that might jeopardize this cause!</p>

					<p>The Foreign Office has defended its stance of not paying a ransom to  help free a British couple taken hostage by Somali pirates three months  ago.</p>
<p>It issued a statement after an anti-piracy maritime group insisted it  should be allowed to negotiate a payment for Paul and Rachel Chandler.</p>
<div id="attachment_219" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 236px"><img class="size-full wp-image-219" title="chand" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/chand.jpg" alt="This picture of Mrs Chandler was released on Sunday" width="226" height="282" /><p class="wp-caption-text">This picture of Mrs Chandler was released on Sunday</p></div>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
The Foreign Office said concessions would only &#8220;encourage&#8221; future  kidnaps.</p>
<p>The Chandlers, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, were captured while sailing  towards Tanzania on 23 October.</p>
<p>The latest news of the couple emerged on Sunday. They spoke of their  ordeal through a news agency which had been allowed to send a  photographer when they were examined by a doctor last week.</p>
<p>The Chandlers said they were being badly treated and were in urgent need  of help.<br />
The pirates have threatened to kill the couple if their demands for $7m  (£4.4m) are not met.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Green light&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Nick Davis, chairman of the Merchant Maritime Warfare Centre, which  provides anti-piracy advice and training, said the Chandlers&#8217; captors  were running out of patience.</p>
<p>&#8220;The door is open for them to be released. Somebody needs to pick up the  gauntlet and run with it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the amounts involved, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth trying to bring  anyone to justice. We just need to get Paul and Rachel home.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the people who know what needs to be done, we can do it, we just  need to be allowed to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Davis said he could not do anything without the &#8220;green light&#8221; from  the Foreign Office and the Chandlers&#8217; family.</p>
<p>He said the pirates would need to feel they were talking to somebody with the authorization and means to secure the release.</p>
<p>A Foreign Office spokesperson said it had &#8220;never attempted to block any  activity by Mr Davis&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although there is no UK law against third parties paying ransoms, we  counsel against them doing so because we believe that making concessions  only encourages future kidnaps.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is why the government does not make or facilitate substantive  concessions to hostage takers.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Please help&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>The couple were examined by a surgeon on Thursday and Mrs Chandler was  reportedly in a poor state of mental and physical health.</p>
<div id="attachment_222" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 236px"><img class="size-full wp-image-222" title="chand2" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/chand2.jpg" alt="Mr Chandler was being held at a separate location from his wife" width="226" height="170" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mr Chandler was being held at a separate location from his wife</p></div>
<p>Mrs Chandler, who was being held in a separate location from her  husband, told the news agency AFP: &#8220;I&#8217;m old, I&#8217;m 56 and my husband is 60  years old. We need to be together because we have not much time left.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Chandler appeared in better health than his wife but was also under  extreme stress, AFP said.<br />
&#8220;I just want to say please, to my government, get me and my wife out of  here,&#8221; he said.<br />
&#8220;We have no money and we can&#8217;t pay a ransom. We just need the government  to help, anyone who can help us out of here.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Downing Street spokesman said the government was in regular contact  with the Chandler family.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prime minister&#8217;s view is that hostage taking is never justified and  we would like to repeat the government&#8217;s call that Paul and Rachel  Chandler should be released immediately and unconditionally,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are doing everything we can to secure their release.&#8221;</p>

					<p>Her face is gaunt and drawn, her frame skeletal and weak.</p>
<p>The shocking effects of captivity are all too clear in this picture of Rachel Chandler, who has been held by Somali pirates for the last three months.</p>
<p>The image was taken by a French news agency that was allowed to accompany a doctor who examined Mrs Chandler and her husband Paul, who are being held separately.</p>
<div id="attachment_207" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 478px"><img class="size-full wp-image-207" title="Photo of Rachel Chandler at a location in central Somalia, where she is being held by pirates" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/article-0-0818ED80000005DC-935_468x765.jpg" alt="Photo of Rachel Chandler at a location in central Somalia, where she is being held by pirates" width="468" height="765" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo of Rachel Chandler at a location in central Somalia, where she is being held by pirates</p></div>
<p>The strain on 56-year-old Mrs Chandler’s face is clearly visible as she sits with her dress hanging loosely from her thin shoulders.</p>
<p>Yesterday she renewed her plea for urgent help, saying: ‘We have not much time left and are being badly treated. Please help us – these people are not treating us well.’</p>
<p>She went on: ‘I’m old, I’m 56, and my husband is 60 years old. We need to be together because we have not much time left. These people are treating us so cruelly.’</p>
<p>This is only the second time Mrs Chandler, an economist, has been seen since she and her husband were kidnapped in October at gunpoint as they sailed in their yacht towards Tanzania.</p>
<p>The last time was in November, when a video taken by the kidnappers – who are demanding a £1.9million ransom – was shown on Channel 4.</p>
<div id="attachment_208" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 478px"><img class="size-full wp-image-208" title="Mrs Chandler" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/article-0-08190397000005DC-35_468x313.jpg" alt="Mrs Chandler being examined by Somali doctor Abdi Mohamed Helmi at a location in central Somalia" width="468" height="313" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mrs Chandler being examined by Somali doctor Abdi Mohamed Helmi at a location in central Somalia</p></div>
<p>They have made other pleas for help in desperate phone calls, most recently on January 21, but the physical deterioration in yesterday’s new images are clear.</p>
<p>The Somalian doctor who examined Mrs Chandler said she was suffering a heavy ‘ mental’ toll as well, which was manifested in ‘insomnia’.</p>
<p>Surgeon Mohamed Helmi Hangul, who spent three weeks securing permission to visit the couple, said she was ‘mentally ill’, ‘anxious’, ‘disorientated’ and had been asking repeatedly for her husband.</p>
<p>Mr Chandler also appeared gaunt in the video taken last Thursday but released last night. His ribs could be seen as he lifted his shirt to be checked by the doctor, who reported he had a cough and a fever.</p>
<div id="attachment_209" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 478px"><img class="size-full wp-image-209" title="Paul Chandler examined by somali doctor" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/article-0-0818F975000005DC-459_468x662.jpg" alt="Paul Chandler is examined by the Somali doctor: The pair are being held in separate locations in rugged areas between the coastal village of Elhur and the small town of Amara " width="468" height="662" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Paul Chandler is examined by the Somali doctor: The pair are being held in separate locations in rugged areas between the coastal village of Elhur and the small town of Amara </p></div>
<div id="attachment_210" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 478px"><img class="size-full wp-image-210" title="Paul Chandler, 60, pleaded for help after admitting the conditions they were being held in were 'difficult' " src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/article-0-0818F18B000005DC-88_468x342.jpg" alt="Paul Chandler, 60, pleaded for help after admitting the conditions they were being held in were 'difficult' " width="468" height="342" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Paul Chandler, 60, pleaded for help after admitting the conditions they were being held in were &#39;difficult&#39; </p></div>
<p>In the video, filmed by the AFP photographer, Mr Chandler, a retired quantity surveyor, called on the British Government to intervene.</p>
<p>‘We are innocent. We have done no wrong. We have no money and can’t pay a ransom. We just need the Government to help, anyone who can get us out of here,’ he said. ‘Day after day and this is 98 days of solitary confinement, no exercise. I don’t know what to do.’ Mr Chandler finally pleaded: ‘Will somebody please help? The government or somebody else.’</p>
<p>Dr Hangul added he had not been allowed to bring any drugs with him but left a prescription-with the pirates. ‘I gave them some advice and told them, “Your hostages can die. All you want is money so treat them well, let them reunite”,’ he said.</p>
<p>Mrs Chandler’s brother, Stephen Collett, was too distressed to comment last night. A family friend said: ‘This is a highly distressing time for the family. They know the stakes are high and they are in an impossible position. The pirates want an unaffordable ransom and the Government won’t pay it.’</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211" title="The Chandlers time line" src="http://www.savethechandlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/article-1247482-081AB209000005DC-316_468x489.jpg" alt="The Chandlers time line" width="468" height="489" /></p>
<p>There has been sporadic communication with the Chandlers since they were captured, although this was the first time a journalist had been able to meet them.</p>
<p>Eleven days ago Mr Chandler spoke to ITV news, explaining their captives had ‘set a deadline of three or four days’, after which they expected to them to ‘kill us and abandon us in the desert’. In a separate call, Mrs Chandler said she had been hit with an object she believed was a gun.</p>
<p>A gang member told the Daily Mail last month that the couple, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, would be shot by the end of February if they were not paid a $3million ransom.<br />
The Chandlers are being held in rugged areas between the coastal village of Elhur and the small inland town of Amara but are moved every 48 hours.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary David Miliband has already insisted the Government will not become involved in any ransom payments.</p>
<p>A Foreign Office spokesman last night said: ‘We are doing everything we can to help secure their release.’</p>

					<p>Somali pirates yesterday threatened a fight to the death that would endanger a hostage British couple if British forces attempt to rescue their captives.</p>
<p>“We die first before they get freed,” said one of the pirates, contacted by satellite telephone.</p>
<p>Paul and Rachel Chandler, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, were captured on October 23 as they sailed their yacht, the 38ft Lynn Rival, from the Seychelles towards Tanzania.</p>
<p>The pirates’ new threat follows reports that an operation mounted by the Special Boat Service to rescue the couple was “bungled” before it could reach them because of technical problems.</p>
<p>If anyone interrupts our negotiations to get the payment of a ransom, it will be a risk for them [the Chandlers],” said “Gelle”, one of the pirates guarding the couple. “So we advise that no one interrupts our current good discussions.”</p>
<p>In the only comment that held some hope for the Chandlers, Gelle said that they had lowered their demand from $7m to $2m “or whatever price that we agree”. It was a clear signal that the pirates are open to offers.</p>
<p>Last week a Greek tanker, Maran Centaurus, was released for a reported $5.5m to $7m.</p>
<p>Gelle said that his group had spoken yesterday and on Friday with one of five brokers supposedly involved in negotiating a ransom. He said he believed the brokers were negotiating with “close relatives of our hostages, or other people trusted on behalf of them”.</p>
<p>The pirates are based in Haradheere, a fishing village north of the capital, Mogadishu. As well as the Chandlers, pirates are holding 11 ships, including the British-flagged chemical tanker St James Park which was seized on December 28.</p>
<p>Chandler, 59, said in an earlier telephone interview with ITV News, broadcast last week, that he and his wife, 55, had been separated and beaten and that he expected to be killed within “three or four days”.</p>
<p>Gelle denied the Chandlers were living under difficult conditions. “Okay, maybe they don’t feel good or comfortable but according to us they are fine,” he said.</p>
<p>“We also live in this situation so we do not think that they are that different from us. Once we get food, we share with them, and when there is a shortage of food they suffer with us.”</p>

					<p>Based on web traffic, there may be a chance that the pirates are looking at this site.  While we havent reached the goal of $100,000 yet, I feel its important for them to see that progress is being made to collect the amount.</p>
<p>From here on forward, I will be updating the amount you see on the right hand side of the page as donations arrive.</p>
<p>I am hoping that this will give the pirates some assurance that someone else is trying to raise the money who is not bound by British Government rules.</p>
