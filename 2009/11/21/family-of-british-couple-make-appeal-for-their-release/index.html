<p>The family of the kidnapped British sailors have pleaded for their release.   Im glad to see that they are trying to persuade the pirated to do the &#8220;humanitarian thing and let them go&#8221;, as quoted by BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner. </p>
<p>According to reports it appears that they (the Chandlers) are very concerned about an Islamist group in Somalia called Al-Shabaab possibly &#8216;purchasing&#8217; them and placing more demands.  </p>
<p>In a video released yesterday Mrs Chandler said: “We are told that there is a terrorist cell, or a fanatic cell, searching for us and we are also feeling very much under threat now that these people themselves won’t hesitate to take our lives.”</p>

		<p>ok! I just came upon this, The Heavenly Father has it in control NOW, He has placed this on the Hearts of A True Prophet, Who was directed to put out this info and awareness to Brethren who will Pray and Fast THURSDAY sun up to SUNDOWN, the way this True Prophet sees it from Monday Morning 2am, is they NEED A MIRACLE! Their is more than Money at stake HERE, Demonic forces has taken an interest in this Married Couple&#8217;s Life, They are a Testimony to all Covenant Married Life long Partners in a World which has 50% Divorce rate in the Churches..Satan is a lier, the Heavenly Father is well able  HE IS A MIRACLE GOD; THERE IS NONE LIKE HIM, THE FACT THAT THEIR CAPTORS ARE MUSLIM! SAY A LOT! THIS IS A BATTLE  FOR THE TESTIMONY AND SOULS OF A COUPLE WHO BY NO ACCIDENT HAS BIBLICAL NAMES (PAUL &amp; RACHEL) I AM TELLING YOU, I STUMBLED UPON THIS MONDAY MORNING, I SAW IT SLIGHTLY BEFORE AS A LOW KEYED NEWS, But that was  all, Until Monday Morning, The Heavenly Father (Yahweh ) said to me, they need HIS INTERVENTION, MAN IS NOT GOING TO DO IT, ADD THEM TO THE WEEKLY MARRIAGE FAST THURSDAY..It&#8217;s has been a battle to even get my mail accounts to send out this, Super Natural hindrances, So they are in a spiritual  battle as well. With Christianity&#8217;s Enemy. If they are JEW, makes it worst, If they are Christians, same..It is not by Chance this  Couple was Choose by spiritual darkness, and when was the last time another Muslim Group heard of showing interest to purchase them or other captors..There is something more to this, I feel for them, to come this Far thru Thick and thin ( any Married Couple who has been together for the numbers of years they have been know this) Then to be captured while enjoying some form of retirement with Your life Long Mate, to be KILLED Naaa! MERCY YAHWEH! DELIVER THEM GOD! touch the Hearts of others so they PRAY! this is a CALL TO JOIN IN THE MARRIAGE FAST EACH AND EVERY THURSDAY, From Sunup-until Sundown Thursday, Pray and Fast for Your marriage, Your Friends, the Chandlers, in Yahshua&#8217;s name! In Jesus name!! HALLELUYAH! He is able&#8230;If You want to let me know how this has touched Your Hearts you can reach me at <a href="mailto:tabernacleintheisland@yahoo.com">tabernacleintheisland@yahoo.com</a>, I will give you my number then, so we can Pray together for them or You leave your Number I have Long Distance&#8230;  (MARRIAGES ARE UNDER ATTACK WORLD WIDE) The Holy Scriptures say this&#8230;Deu 32:30  How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up? &#8230;Then Jesus/Yahshua said this&#8230;.(it&#8217;s in red letters KJV)&#8230;Mat 18:19  AGAIN I SAY UNTO YOU, THAT IF TWO OF YOU SHALL AGREE ON EARTH AS TOUCHING ANY THING THAT THEY SHALL ASK, IT SHALL BE DONE FOR THEM OF MY FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN.. GOD! YAHWEH!! JEHOVAH! IN YAHSHUA&#8217;S NAME! IN JESUS NAME! WE NEED MERCY FOR THE CHANDLERS TO BE SET FREE! LOOSE THEN DEVILS SET THEM FREE! IN JESUS NAME! WE AGREE FATHER, WE HAVE MORE THAN TWO AGREEING ON THIS HELP GOD! GIVE THEN FAVORS! SET THE CAPTIVE FREE, DRAW THEN CLOSER TO YOU IN THIS TIME FATHER, MERCY!! RAISE UP A DELIVER! YOU DID IT FOR THE HEBREWS IN BONDAGE BY THEIR CAPTORS AT THAT TIME, IN EGYPT, YOU MADE A WAY! YOUR THE WAY MAKER WE AGREE GOD!!! YOU SAID IF ANY TWO OF US&#8230;Ohhhh GOD! SUCH HUMBLE LOOKING COUPLE, WHAT A TESTIMONY IN A AGE WHEN DIVORCE IS RAMPANT, THEY ARE IN NEED OF DELIVERANCE, LET YOUR POWER BE KNOW IN  THIS YAHWEH..Father, You know in all my life I have never been moved to go on these blogs, I am doing it because You moved up my heart and direct me to search for more info, then I find this with more about them, Yahweh You are so faithful! I see how You have raised up others far away, on the other side of the World, Strengthen this blogger whoever they are God! send more help to strengthen them to keep this GOING. Yahweh! I am in aw, I know this is YOU, You did spared the Space Shuttle same way, after the 1st one had explode.You said IF You had found one! only One You wouldn&#8217;t have destroyed that Place, We are more than ONE here Yahweh! strengthen Rachel God, She must be so intimidated, and Her husband for seeing His life Long Mate suffering thru this, Oo God!!! Strengthen him right now, let their Hearts be hopeful and confuse the Enemy&#8217;s! let those that are seeking them more be desolate, confuse them father so they will group around in finding their ways, open the eyes and hearts of those who are making the decision at the top of this Kidnapping Chain, that they have picked a lowly Couple on who has not the amount of Mammon they seek&#8230; Father dispatch their Ministering Angels, to take care not to have some stupid rescue mission which can bundled, we don&#8217;t want to take any chances with these Demons who would love nothing better than let some stray or intentional bullet kill or injure either one of them! they need to be alive enjoying each other&#8230; Eph 5:28  So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself&#8230; Father We feel for them, I feel for Paul God!  Eph 5:33  Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband&#8230;make a way for Your Servant sake.. JESUS! HE made a wrong judgment (as we all do) and the ENEMY came in like a thief..More than anything I ask that they in this Once in a life time crisis reach out to You to save them, as You said in Your Word You Promise Life..Joh 10:10  The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.   AMEN!<br />
One more thing Heavenly Father, I know few will mock this post, the Mockers are out there just as You said they would be..Isa 28:22  Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth. ..Psa 35:16  With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth..Jud 1:18  How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts&#8230;.( but help Us to forgive them, in Jesus/Yahshua&#8217;s name )..</p>
<p>I BLESS YOU FOR PROVIDING THE SPACE TO POST (I had no idea I would write so long or be in any blog it&#8217;s all spontaneous/as I am lead) &amp; FOR YOUR EFFORTS IN THIS, MAY YOU GO FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH &amp; YOUR MEAL BARREL NEVER RUNS DRY &amp; May Your rewards never be erased;IN YAHSHUA&#8217;S/JESUS&#8217;S NAME! HALLELUYAH!..(2Chronicles 20:20;Mat 10:40  He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.<br />
Mat 10:41  He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet&#8217;s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man&#8217;s reward. </p>
<p>True Prophet Bro Yoel</p>

		<p>Humm! I went to look up Rachel&#8217;s Name in HEbrew..H7354<br />
רחל râchêl raw-khale&#8217; The same as H7353; Rachel, a wife of Jacob: &#8211; Rachel.<br />
H7353  רחל râchêl  raw-khale&#8217;<br />
From an unused root meaning to journey; a ewe (the females being the predominant element of a flock), (as a good Traveller): &#8211; ewe, sheep.</p>
<p>Wow!TO JOURNEY-Traveller, isn&#8217;t that amazing? She/they were Journeying&#8230;Traveling by Sea around&#8230;their is something more to why the other Muslim Terrorist wants to buy them, something more..BECAUSE THE MUSLIMS READ THE OT. THEY ALSO ARE CONCERN ABOUT RACHEL&#8217;S TOMB (over there in O GOD MERCY!!</p>
<p>Gen 29:16  And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel&#8230;Gen 29:17  Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.<br />
Gen 29:18  And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.<br />
Gen 29:20  And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.  { IT&#8217;S ALSO A WELL KNOW PRAYER AND WISH/HOPE, OR THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO HAVE THEIR FEMALE BLESS LIKE Rachel, this is a Prayer they Pray both Jew and Muslim(Christians are not to up on it, they don&#8217;t teach them, You hear more about Mary, than the Many other Holy Women in the scriptures)<br />
Rth 4:11  And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah,&amp; be famous in Bethlehem:<br />
She is buried in Bethlehem, this is one of the HOLY sites which the Muslims always destroy ( they desecrated Rachel&#8217;s tomb in the 2nd Inte-fada) &amp; Riot/hindrances when the Christians/Jews are making Pilgrimage to JACOB&#8217;S Wife&#8217;s Grave, it make no sense, because they reverence Jacob, as a patriarch, so why desecrate HIS WIFE&#8221;S GRAVE?&#8230;(Jacob said this in)Gen 48:7 &amp; as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way,when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath:&amp; I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.</p>
