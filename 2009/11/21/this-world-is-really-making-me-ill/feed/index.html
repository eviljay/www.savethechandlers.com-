		<description>After realizing, last night, that I had not heard any recent news about this couple&#039;s status, I woke up this morning with them still on my mind - so I Googled, and found this website. I have prayed to Jesus for their release and safe return.  

I have also noticed that there has been a complete absence of anyone affiliated with this couple requesting prayers for the Chandlers, or mentioning God at all.  That is troubling as our Creator can soften even the hardest of hearts towards making the right decisions. I encourage the Chandler&#039;s family and friends to pray - God, not &quot;man&quot;, but GOD CAN work it so this couple IS released - but someone out there has to be praying constantly in order for this to happen.  Our Creator is an amazing God in that He won&#039;t force Himself upon us, but is always there when we do call on Him. 

I also found the following statements to be, not only contradictive, but also troubling:

&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Foreign Secretary David Miliband has already insisted the Government will not become involved in any ransom payments.

A Foreign Office spokesman last night said: ‘We are doing everything we can to help secure their release.’&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;

The Govt. refuses to become involved in any ransom payment, yet turns around to say that they are &#039;doing everything&#039; they can to help secure their release. 
If you are refusing to &#039;become involved in any ransom payment&#039;, then you are NOT doing  &quot;everything&quot; you can to secure their release. 

I would imagine if this were Foreign Secretary David Miliband&#039;s parents, he would truly, TRULY, be doing &quot;everything&quot; he could to secure their release. 

I remind you that this is not a &#039;flea market&#039; situation where you have the luxury of negotiating a fair price for a &quot;product&quot;, or decide that *you* feel the price is just too expensive to consider a &quot;purchase&quot; at all. 
These are two human beings, Mr. Miliband - someone&#039;s parents, aunts, uncles, sisters, brothers - and most important, they are children of our Almighty God. Has humanity come down to being too expensive to bother with? 

God bless ALL involved in this heart wrenching situation, especially Paul and Rachel Chandler.
